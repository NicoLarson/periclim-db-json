To maintain the ecosystem functions of carbon sequestration and timber supply in tropical production forests over a long term, forest management must be sustainable under changing climate conditions. Individual-based forest models are useful tools to enhance our understanding about the long-term effects of harvest and climate change on forest dynamics because they link empirical field data with simulations of ecological processes. The objective of this study is to analyze the combined effects of selective logging and climate change on biomass stocks and timber harvest in a tropical forest in French Guiana. By applying a forest model, we simulated natural forest dynamics under the baseline scenario of current climate conditions and compared the results with scenarios of selective logging under climate change. The analyses revealed how substantially forest dynamics are altered under different scenarios of climate change. (1) Repeated logging within recovery times decreased biomass and timber harvest, irrespective of the intensity of climate change. (2) With moderate climate change as envisaged by the 5th IPCC Assessment Report (representative concentration pathway 2.6), the average biomass remained the same as in the baseline scenario (−1%), but with intensive climate change (RCP 8.5), the average biomass decreased by 12%. (3) The combination of selective logging and climate change increased the likelihood of changes in forest dynamics, driven mainly by rising temperatures. Under RCP 8.5, the average timber harvest was almost halved, regardless of the logging cycle applied. An application-oriented use of forest models will help to identify opportunities to reduce the effects of unwanted ecosystem changes in a changing environment. To ensure that ecosystem functions in production forests are maintained under climate change conditions, appropriate management strategies will help to maintain biomass and harvest in production forests.","date_added":"2022-01-28 17:45:33","date_modified":"2022-01-28 17:49:26","pages":"119166","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Abovegroundbiomass","Climate change mitigation","Forest degradation","Forest management","French Guiana","Individual-based forest modeling","Paracou","Timber harvest","Tropical forestry"]},{"key":"UA5NYDV5","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Souza","lastName":"Aline Cavalcante de"},{"firstName":"Prevedello","lastName":" Jayme Augusto"}],"title":"Climate change and biological invasion as additional threats to an imperiled palm","publication_title":"Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation","issn":"2530-0644","doi":"10.1016/j.pecon.2021.02.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2530064421000183","abstract_note":"Climate change and biological invasion are major threats to biodiversity, but their combined effects have rarely been quantified. The introduction of congeneric non-native species, in particular, can be especially problematic for native species due to competition and hybridization. Here, we quantify the impacts of climate change on the distribution of an ecologically and economically important native species, Euterpe edulis, and on the invasion potential of its congeneric E. oleracea, across the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We modelled current and future environmental suitability for both species, using a comprehensive set of algorithms and climatic scenarios, and quantified the extent of overlap of their environmentally suitable areas. Climate change reduced environmental suitability for E. edulis, but had neutral effects on E. oleracea. Current and future overlap areas, where competition and hybridization are more likely, were concentrated mostly in the southeastern region of Brazil. Our results suggest that native and non-native congeneric species respond differently to climate change, and that climate change and the introduction of E. oleracea are additional threats to the threatened E. edulis. We recommend avoiding new introductions of E. oleracea especially in the southeastern portion of the Atlantic Forest, and the maintenance of protected areas especially in the southern region.","date_added":"2022-01-28 17:45:33","date_modified":"2022-01-28 17:49:26","pages":"216-224","language":"en","automatic_tags":["AtlanticForest","Congeneric species","Ecological niche modelling","Exotic species","Hybridization","Potential distribution"]},{"key":"HKLU6HDJ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Corlett","lastName":"Richard T."},{"firstName":"Tomlinson","lastName":" Kyle W."}],"title":"Climate Change and Edaphic Specialists: Irresistible Force Meets Immovable Object?","publication_title":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","issn":"0169-5347","doi":"10.1016/j.tree.2019.12.007","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534719303520","abstract_note":"Species exposed to anthropogenic climate change can acclimate, adapt, move, or be extirpated.

We calculated a tolerance index combining environmental thermal adequacy with the b-d model, which consider survival and reproductive rates to calculate population dynamics.

The Amazon basin contains the largest rainforest on Earth, almost 5.8 million km2, and occupies about 40% of South America; more than 60% of the basin is located in Brazil and the rest in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Over the past decade the positive role of tropical rainforests in capturing large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been demonstrated. In response to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropical forests act as a global carbon sink. Main body Accumulation of carbon in the tropical terrestrial biosphere strongly contributes to slowing the rate of increase of CO2 into the atmosphere, thus resulting in the reduction of greenhouse gas effect. Tropical rainforests have been estimated to account for 32–36% of terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) that is the difference between total forest photosynthesis and plant respiration. Tropical rainforests have been acting as a strong carbon sink in this way for decades. However, over the past years, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially CO2, in the atmosphere have significantly affected the net carbon balance of tropical rainforests, and have warmed the planet substantially driving climate changes through more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods. The role of tropical forests in mitigating climate change is therefore critical. Over the past 30 years almost 600,000 km2 have been deforested in Brazil alone due to the rapid development of Amazonia, this is the reason why currently the region is one of the ‘hotspots’ of global environmental change on the planet. Conclusion Deforestation represents the second largest anthropogenic source of CO2 to the atmosphere, after fossil fuel combustion. There are many causes of deforestation, including socioeconomic and natural factors, such as clear-cutting for agriculture, ranching and development, unsustainable logging for timber, as well as droughts, fires and degradation due to climate change. About natural causes of forest degradation, in the context of the Amazon, the major agent of change in the forest ecosystem would most likely be decreased dry-season precipitation. Of the 23 global climate models employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 2007 report, 50–70% predict a substantial (above 20%) reduction of dry-season rainfall in eastern Amazonia under mid-range greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, 40% in central Amazonia and 20% in the west. While annual carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion have been continually increasing since 1960s, historical trends of deforestation and associated carbon emissions have remained poorly understood.","date_added":"2022-01-28 17:45:33","date_modified":"2022-01-28 17:49:27","pages":"11","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Air pollution and respiratory diseases","Anthropogenic emissions of CO","Bronchial asthma","Deforestation and climate change","Greenhouse gas emissions","Interaction between climate change and allergy","Respiratory allergy"]},{"key":"H9M6PA8Q","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2009","author":[{"firstName":"Currie","lastName":"Duncan E.J."},{"firstName":"Wowk","lastName":" Kateryna"}],"title":"Climate Change and CO 2 in the Oceans and Global Oceans Governance: Improving Governance of the World's Oceans","publication_title":"Carbon & Climate Law Review","issn":"18649904, 21908230","doi":"","url":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24323660","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-01-28 17:48:36","date_modified":"2022-01-28 17:48:36","pages":"387-404","language":"","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"62EGTWKR","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Imlay","lastName":"Tara L."},{"firstName":"Mann","lastName":" Hilary A.

This includes stages of the annual cycle, such as migration, when behaviour, such as departure timing, is also affected by circannual and circadian cues. In birds, the initiation of autumn migratory movements is often related to the timing of the cessation of the breeding season. However, less is known as to whether breeding season carryover effects also affect the pace of migration. To determine whether there are carryover effects from the breeding season to migration in barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, we monitored nests and used the Motus Wildlife Tracking System to determine migratory departure dates and the pace of migration. Barn swallows that finished breeding later in the summer initiated migration later and migrated faster through North America than swallows that finished breeding earlier in the summer. However, daily flight speeds were unrelated to the timing of the breeding season, suggesting that late-departing individuals increased their overall pace by reducing stopovers. Our results suggest that although barn swallows do not establish a nonbreeding territory, there are constraints during migration that require late-departing individuals to compensate for carryover effects from the breeding season. Late departure is not necessarily disadvantageous if individuals are able to ‘catch-up’ to early-departing individuals, but more work is needed to assess whether late departure and the faster pace of migration affect the subsequent survival of these individuals.","date_added":"2022-05-13 10:45:38","date_modified":"2022-05-13 10:45:38","pages":"207-214","language":"en","automatic_tags":["migration","annual cycle","automated telemetry","barn swallow","Motus Wildlife Tracking System","movement","postbreeding","speed"]},{"key":"EEM2HYDQ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Riquetti","lastName":"Nelva B."},{"firstName":"Mello","lastName":" Carlos R."},{"firstName":"Beskow","lastName":" Samuel"},{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":" Marcelo R."}],"title":"Rainfall erosivity in South America: Current patterns and future perspectives","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138315","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720318283","abstract_note":"Rainfall erosivity is the driving factor for soil erosion and can be potentially affected by climate change, impacting agriculture and the environment. In this study, we sought to project the impact of climate change on the long-term average annual rainfall erosivity (R-factor) and mean annual precipitation in South America. The CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5 global circulation models (GCMs) and the average of the GCMs (GCM-Ensemble) downscaled by the Eta/CPTEC model at a spatial resolution of 20 km in the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 were applied in this study. A geographical model to estimate the R-factor across South America was fitted. This model was based on latitude, longitude, altitude, and mean annual precipitation as inputs obtained from the WorldClim database. Using this model, the first R-factor map for South America was developed (for the baseline period: 1961–2005). The GCMs projected mean annual precipitation for three 30-year time periods (time slices: 2010–2040; 2041–2070; 2071–2099). These projections were used to run the R-factor model to assess the impact of climate change. It was observed that the changes were more pronounced in the Amazon Forest region (namely, the North Region, NR, and the Andes North Region, ANR) with a strong reduction in the mean annual precipitation and R-factor throughout the century. The highest increase in the R-factor was projected on the Central and South Andes regions (CAR and SAR) because of the increase in the mean annual precipitation projected by the GCMs. The GCMs pointed contradictory projections for the Central-South Region (CSR), indicating greater uncertainty. An increase in the R-factor was projected for this region, eastern Argentina, and southern Brazil, whereas a decrease in the R-factor was expected for southeastern Brazil. In general, the GCMs projected reductions in the R-factor and annual precipitation for South America, with the highest changes projected from the baseline to the 2010–2040 time slice.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"138315","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Continental scale","R-factor","Soil erosion"]},{"key":"33D9DYRB","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Hilsenroth","lastName":"Jana"},{"firstName":"Grogan","lastName":" Kelly A."},{"firstName":"Frazer","lastName":" Thomas K."}],"title":"Assessing the effects of increasing surface seawater temperature on black pearl production in French Polynesia: A bioeconomic simulation","publication_title":"Ecological Economics","issn":"0921-8009","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106914","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800920322059","abstract_note":"Production of French Polynesia's black pearls is entirely dependent on oceanic conditions.

Production strategies, including grafting intensity, grafting timeframe, and overall pearl quality distribution were included in the simulation to identify production strategies which maximized net present value (NPV) over ten-years. Across all simulated management scenarios, production occurring under projected seawater temperatures resulted in an average decline of 29.1% in expected NPV. Overall, the change in expected NPV stemmed from a decline in the quantity of pearls produced, decline in the quality of pearls produced, and an increase in time between production stages. The optimal production strategy for current and projected seawater temperatures across all management scenarios was to graft a whole cohort of oysters in December with the best possible pearl quality distribution. However, with production occurring with other pearl quality distributions, optimal grafting timeframe and intensity differs between temperature regimes. Aligning production strategies with seawater temperatures can ameliorate economic losses.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"106914","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Aquaculture","Economic impact","Pearl quality","Tahitian pearls"]},{"key":"5R7RCE67","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Ducrettet","lastName":"Manon"},{"firstName":"Forget","lastName":" Pierre-Michel"},{"firstName":"Ulloa","lastName":" Juan Sebastian"},{"firstName":"Yguel","lastName":" Benjamin"},{"firstName":"Gaucher","lastName":" Philippe"},{"firstName":"Princé","lastName":" Karine"},{"firstName":"Haupert","lastName":" Sylvain"},{"firstName":"Sueur","lastName":" Jérôme"}],"title":"Monitoring canopy bird activity in disturbed landscapes with automatic recorders: A case study in the tropics","publication_title":"Biological Conservation","issn":"0006-3207","doi":"10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108574","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320719318324","abstract_note":"Tropical forests are facing threats that may affect the dynamics of seed dispersers which participate in the forest regeneration.

We deployed nine acoustic recorders over 29 days along a road that connects French Guiana to Brazil. We used template matching to automatically detect the vocalizations of R. tucanus.

The number of vocalizations varied according to time of the day with peaks at dawn and dusk. The number of vocalizations did not differ significantly among sites, they were not affected by habitat type, and they were only marginally influenced by human activity. These results indicate that the vocal activity of a key conservation species can be monitored automatically in a non-invasive way. The species targeted, R. tucanus, does not seem to be significantly impacted by the road and local human activity. This might be related to the mobility of the species, which can easily cross the road, as well as low local forestry pressure.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"108574","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Tropicalforest","Biodiversity monitoring","Ecoacoustics","Human activity"]},{"key":"A92HJ8MJ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Zhiyan"},{"firstName":"Nie","lastName":" Tianyi"},{"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":" Xin"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":" Jiwei"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":" Bin"},{"firstName":"Cui","lastName":" Dongyang"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":" Xinxin"}],"title":"Organic carbon remineralization rate in global marine sediments: A review","publication_title":"Regional Studies in Marine Science","issn":"2352-4855","doi":"10.1016/j.rsma.2021.102112","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352485521004825","abstract_note":"The remineralization of organic carbon (OC) in marine sediments has crucial implications for global carbon cycling and climate change.

We studied tree mortality by mode of death in 72 1-ha permanent plots spanning 64km2 of tropical moist forest in Reserva Ducke, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Plots were re-censused twice (2003–2005 and 2005–2008). Tree mode of death was assigned for trees ⩾4cm dbh as standing, uprooted or snapped. We also recorded whether trees died alone or were pushed over by treefalls. Standing death was predominant, representing 54% of deaths of trees with dbh⩾10cm, followed by snapping (26%) and uprooting (14%). Trees that fell alone represented 25% of deaths, while 16% were pushed over. Most small fallen dead trees (4⩽dbh<30cm) were pushed over by other trees, while most large dead trees (dbh⩾30cm) died alone. Standing mortality was weakly related to soil and topography, but 20% of variation in uprooted mortality and 11% in snapped mortality of trees with dbh⩾10cm was explained by soil and topography. The variation in mortality explained for small trees (18% for uprooted mortality and 13% for snapped mortality) was higher than for large trees (14% for mortality by snapping only). In spite of little variation in mortality associated directly with soil and slope, analyses assessing the effect of topographic categories (plateaux, slope, and valley) on tree mortality detected higher differences, even though causal factors remain unidentified because topographic position may encompass both topographic and soil properties. There was an increase from the first to the second census interval in the effects associated with soil and topography on tree mortality by uprooting and snapping, and this was likely due to storms, which led to a disproportional increase in tree mortality for these tree modes of death. Presently, uprooting and snapping mortality are not dominant and the use of soil and topographic variables for modeling of tree mortality is therefore limited. However, under predicted climate-change scenarios of higher frequency of extreme storms, soil and topography may become more useful to improve estimates of tree mortality and biomass losses over large areas in Amazonia.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"253-261","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Tropicalforest","Forest dynamics","Permanent plots","Soil gradients","Topographic position","Treefall"]},{"key":"V5MV5L9V","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Meurens","lastName":"François"},{"firstName":"Dunoyer","lastName":" Charlotte"},{"firstName":"Fourichon","lastName":" Christine"},{"firstName":"Gerdts","lastName":" Volker"},{"firstName":"Haddad","lastName":" Nadia"},{"firstName":"Kortekaas","lastName":" Jeroen"},{"firstName":"Lewandowska","lastName":" Marta"},{"firstName":"Monchatre-Leroy","lastName":" Elodie"},{"firstName":"Summerfield","lastName":" Artur"},{"firstName":"Wichgers Schreur","lastName":" Paul J."},{"firstName":"van der Poel","lastName":" Wim H.

Interactions between wildlife and livestock systems contribute to the emergence of zoonotic diseases, especially in the face of globalization, habitat fragmentation and destruction and climate change.

This estimate falls toward the low range of carbon prices for existing carbon offset projects that avoid deforestation.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"481-496","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange mitigation","Guyana","Deforestation","Carbon offsets","Land use change and forestry"]},{"key":"6SW6H3DY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2013","author":[{"firstName":"Collier","lastName":"A.

These indicators suggest that 2018 marked the end of a decade of improvements in safety, wealth, and equality—societal factors that can interact with the environment in multiple ways.

The study also quantifies the potential effects of a similar weather extreme occurring in 2050 under climate change. The study results indicate that weather extremes that affect maize productivity in key grain baskets can negatively affect food security in vulnerable countries. The 2012 weather extreme which occurred in the USA reduced US and global maize production by 29% compared to trend; maize consumption in the country decreased by 5% only and this resulted in less surplus maize for exports from the largest maize exporter in the world. Global maize production decreased by 6% compared to trend. The decrease in global maize production coupled with a reduction in the volume of global maize exports worsened food insecurity in eastern Africa, the Caribbean and Central America and India. The effects of the weather extreme on global food security would be worse, if the latter were to occur under climate change in 2050, assuming no climate change adaptation worldwide over the years. In addition, the hardest-hit regions would remain the same, whether the weather extreme occurs in 2012 instead of 2050: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia and the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. However, sustained growth in per capita income across world economies between 2000 and 2050 would allow few countries in SSA and the LAC region to virtually eliminate hunger within their borders. In these countries, per capita income would be high enough by 2050 to completely offset the negative effect of the weather extreme. The study results are also consistent with USDA׳s estimates on US and global maize production and consumption in 2012 after the weather extreme. Some discrepancy is found on the volume of global maize trade; this implies that the bio-economic model likely overestimates the effect of the weather extreme on food insecurity. However, the trends from the analysis are likely to be valid. Further research would involve using a CGE model that can capture the net effects of weather extremes.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"96-108","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Foodsecurity","Developing world","IMPACT","Spatial bio-economic modelling","Weather extreme"]},{"key":"FPNFA8TI","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Rull","lastName":"Valentí"},{"firstName":"Montoya","lastName":" Encarni"},{"firstName":"Nogué","lastName":" Sandra"},{"firstName":"Safont","lastName":" Elisabet"},{"firstName":"Vegas-Vilarrúbia","lastName":" Teresa"}],"title":"Chapter 2 - Climatic and ecological history of Pantepui and surrounding areas","publication_title":"Biodiversity of Pantepui","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128155912000021","abstract_note":"This chapter reviews the available paleoecological information on Pantepui since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in order to reconstruct the ecological dynamics that have led to the present configuration of plant communities and to unravel the potential environmental drivers involved, with emphasis on regional climate changes and fire. To date, no LGM sediments have been retrieved atop the tepuis, so the vegetation of these summits during the last glaciation remains unknown. Some lowland records suggest that cold LGM climates favored downward migration of temperature-sensitive tepuian species, which drove changes in the taxonomic composition of lowland forests. The available paleoecological record of Pantepui ranges from the early Holocene to the present. These records show two contrasting situations. Some tepui summits exhibit a long vegetation constancy extending back to the mid-Holocene, whereas others document significant changes in sensitive species that have been associated with regional climatic events, such as the Holocene Thermal Maximum, the latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the El Niño Southern Oscillation variability, or recent climatic shifts such as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly or the Little Ice Age. This has been interpreted in terms of the site’s sensitivity, and it has been recommended to obtain past records, preferably on elevational ecotones, where vertical migrations of species are more easily detected. During the last millennium, fire, most probably of anthropogenic origin and likely originating on the surrounding uplands, has been a major driver of vegetation change on some tepuis.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"33-54","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Holocene","biotic responses","community assembly","paleoclimates","paleoecology","paleofires","palynology","vegetation dynamics"]},{"key":"DE8JB82N","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Kormos","lastName":"C.

Moreover, we have experimentally incubated eggs of this species in beach sand under standardized conditions, but at different realistic levels of sand water content, varying from 1% to 12%. On the beaches, females nested from the intertidal zone to the lower part of the sand vegetation dunes, where nests were exposed to a wide range of sand water contents that ranged from 0.8% to 22%. However, both field and experimental studies revealed a strong negative correlation between sand water content and emergence success (field study: r=−0.73, P<0.0001; experiment: r=−0.84, P<0.0001). In the field, mean emergence success varied from 0% for the wettest nests to 64% for the driest ones. Nests in wet sand suffered higher mortality, primarily in the earlier developmental stages. Eggs incubated in the driest sand lost mass, but there were no significant effects on hatchling mass or run speed compared to eggs that gained water during incubation. However, hatchling straight carapace length (SCL) was greater in eggs from the driest treatment. The results of the present study inform management of change under future climate change sea level rise scenarios, suggesting that leatherback turtle nesting success should be expected to decrease.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"116-123","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Sea turtles","Egg incubation","Embryonic development","Hatching success","Water content"]},{"key":"MTYEVFJN","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Martins","lastName":"Aline C."},{"firstName":"Bochorny","lastName":" Thuane"},{"firstName":"Pérez-Escobar","lastName":" Oscar A."},{"firstName":"Chomicki","lastName":" Guillaume"},{"firstName":"Monteiro","lastName":" Silvana H.

We hypothesized that reversion to the terrestrial habit accompanied the expansion of savannas. To test this hypothesis we generated a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny and employed comparative methods. We found that Galeandra originated towards the end of the Miocene in Amazonia. The terrestrial clade originated synchronously with the rise of dry vegetation biomes in the last 5 million years, suggesting that aridification dramatically impacted plant diversification and habits in the Neotropics. Shifts in habit impacted floral spur lengths and geographic range size, but not climatic niche. The longer spurs and narrower ranges characterize epiphytic species, which probably adapted to specialized long-tongued Euglossini bee pollinators inhabiting forested habits.

In this paper we develop a discrete-time deterministic water balance model adapted to tropical rainforest climates, and we validate it on a large dataset that includes micro-meteorological and soil parameters along a topographic gradient in a lowland forest of French Guiana. The model computes daily water fluxes (rainfall interception, drainage, tree transpiration and soil plus understorey evapotranspiration) and soil water content using three input variables: daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and solar radiation. A novel statistical approach is employed that uses Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) soil moisture data to estimate water content at permanent wilting point and at field capacity, and root distribution. Inaccuracy of the TDR probes and other sources of uncertainty are taken into account by model calibration through a Bayesian framework. Model daily output includes relative extractable water, REW, i.e. the daily available water standardized by potential available water. The model succeeds in capturing temporal variations in REW regardless of topographic context. The low Root Mean Square Error of Predictions suggests that the model captures the most important drivers of soil water dynamics, i.e. water refilling and root water extraction.

The implementation of effective forest management strategies that are ecologically beneficial plays thus a central role to prevent forest degradation. However, to identify effective forest management strategies, there is a need for methods supporting the decision-making process. The main objective of our study is to analyze the mid- and long-term impacts of different management intensities, such as varying the minimum stem diameter of harvestable commercial trees, on the dynamic and structure of a species-rich tropical lowland forest of French Guiana. Therefore, we have applied the management module of a dynamic forest model and analyzed simulation experiments for undisturbed forest growth and selective logging. For the first time we were able to quantify the mean recovery times of multiple ecosystem functions and properties (biomass, gross primary production, leaf area index, Shanon diversity, timber volume) after selective logging. Accordingly, we validated simulation results (biomass, number of trees harvested) of selective logging with forest inventory data from the last 32 years. The forest model reliably reproduces the observed pre-logging biomass, tree-size distribution, and logging intensity (10 trees/ha, 39 m3/ha). In addition, it became clear how strongly management with higher logging intensities influences the forest in the long term: (1) the mean recovery times of the investigated ecosystem functions were significantly extended. With very intensive logging (116 m3/ha), the average recovery time of forest biomass was almost twice as long as in a moderate simulation scenario (tint 138 a, tmod 77 a). Similar patterns were observed for other ecosystem functions, e.g. timber volume (tint 158 a, tmod 62 a). (2) Additionally, the functional composition shifted, as up to 30% pioneer tree species in particular invaded the forest. This innovative use of forest growth models may help in the development of ecologically reasonable forest management strategies.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"517-525","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biomassproductivity","dbh of lower cutting threshold","Forest gap model FORMIND","Leaf area index","Shannon diversity","Timber volume"]},{"key":"YSYVFGFC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2013","author":[{"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Aurelia F."},{"firstName":"Drucker","lastName":" Adam G."},{"firstName":"Andersen","lastName":" Sven B."},{"firstName":"Simianer","lastName":" Henner"},{"firstName":"van Zonneveld","lastName":" Maarten"}],"title":"Development of a cost-effective diversity-maximising decision-support tool for in situ crop genetic resources conservation: The case of cacao","publication_title":"Ecological Economics","issn":"0921-8009","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.10.018","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800913003285","abstract_note":"This paper undertakes an exploration of the potential application of the Weitzman prioritisation approach to the conservation of plant genetic resources (PGR). Using a case study approach and assuming limited conservation resources, this approach is applied to calculate the maximum diversity which can be conserved based on a clustering of cacao species (Theobroma cacao L.). A conservation budget allocation model applied across a set of ten clusters and nine subclusters of cacao, together with the use of alternative diversity and risk measures, allowed for an evaluation of a range of potential conservation outcomes. Alternative risk measures generally resulted in the allocation of conservation funds to the same priority clusters of cacao (Criollo and Curaray). However, the use of the number of locally common alleles as an alternative to the original Weitzman diversity measure produced a markedly different result, prioritising the Purús cluster in Western Amazonia. The Curaray cluster was highly prioritised under both diversity measures, indicating its distinctiveness relative to both the Criollo and Purús clusters. We conclude that the Weitzman approach can indeed allow diversity comparisons to be made between the outcomes of different PGR conservation strategies, although subjective decisions regarding the choice of diversity and risk measures remain.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"155-164","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Cost-effective prioritisation","Locally common alleles","Plant genetic resources","Risk measures","Weitzman diversity"]},{"key":"6N8DRS2U","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2011","author":[{"firstName":"Soomai","lastName":"Suzuette S."},{"firstName":"Wells","lastName":" Peter G."},{"firstName":"MacDonald","lastName":" Bertrum H."}],"title":"Multi-stakeholder perspectives on the use and influence of “grey” scientific information in fisheries management","publication_title":"Marine Policy","issn":"0308-597X","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2010.07.006","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X10001417","abstract_note":"Scientific information on the shrimp and groundfish resources of the Brazil–Guianas continental shelf has been produced by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM), in collaboration with the national governments exploiting the resources, since the early 1970s.

The flow of information between multiple stakeholders − fishing industry, scientists, fisheries managers, policy makers, and fisheries advisory bodies − was studied based on responses to a survey of key individuals to document each of their roles in the creation, distribution, and use of fisheries information. Content analysis of responses was completed to determine the opportunities and barriers for using scientific information in fisheries management. Salience, credibility, and legitimacy of the information were shadowed by barriers that decreased these attributes. Knowledge about the fishery has increased and technical capabilities have been strengthened through research. At the same time, advances in digital technology have made information more accessible. Yet, the high technical content of fisheries information reduced its usefulness to some stakeholders and formal systems do not exist for distributing or measuring the use and influence of such information in decision making. Communication strategies to promote awareness of the scientific information and aligning scientific information with fisheries policy could increase its use and influence.

The interpretation of a large set of seismic data acquired along the Demerara Plateau and integration with previous seismic stratigraphy and drill studies enables a better understanding of the sedimentary evolution of the outer Demerara marginal plateau. Since the end of the transform activity (late Albian), three sedimentary evolutionary stages have been identified. 1) The Pre-contourite Stage (late Albian to early Miocene) is strongly controlled by the structure of the margin that influences the distribution pattern of post-transform deposits through differential thermal subsidence between transform and divergent segments. 2) The Transitional Stage (middle Miocene to early Pliocene) is expressed as a current-controlled erosive surface resulting from the onset of bottom-current interactions due to the establishment and strengthening of the modern thermohaline circulation that is coeval with the progressive closure of the Isthmus of Panama. 3) The Contourite Stage (middle Pliocene to Holocene) is characterized by the development of a contourite depositional system that is linked to the activity of the North Atlantic Deep Water circulation and by a complex interaction between alongslope and downslope processes. Our study highlights that marginal plateaus might be particularly prone to develop contourite features since they regionally influence ocean current dynamics in guiding and accelerating bottom contour currents. Marginal plateaus should thus be considered as a key target to study bottom current dynamics and paleocirculation patterns.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"104195","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Contourite","Marginal plateau","Atlantic Ocean","Bottom currents","Demerara Plateau","Mass transport deposits"]},{"key":"7N7U4HZW","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Becker","lastName":"Mélanie"},{"firstName":"Karpytchev","lastName":" Mikhail"},{"firstName":"Papa","lastName":" Fabrice"}],"title":"Chapter 7 - Hotspots of Relative Sea Level Rise in the Tropics","publication_title":"Tropical Extremes","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128092484000078","abstract_note":"This chapter presents changes in relative sea level (RSL) along tropical coastlines (30°N–30°S).

Here we focus on recovery of aboveground carbon and timber stocks over the first 32years after selective logging with the CELOS Harvest System in Suriname. Our data are from twelve 1-ha permanent sample plots in which growth, survival, and recruitment of trees ≥15cm diameter were monitored between 1978 and 2012. We evaluate plot-level changes in basal area, stem density, aboveground carbon, and timber stock in response to average timber harvests of 15, 23, and 46m3ha−1. We use a linear mixed-effects model in a Bayesian framework to quantify recovery time for aboveground carbon and timber stock, as well as annualized increments for both. Our statistical models accounted for the uncertainty associated with the height and biomass allometries used to estimate aboveground carbon and increased precision of annualized aboveground carbon increments by including data from forty-one plots located elsewhere on the Guiana Shield. The probabilities of aboveground carbon recovery to pre-logging levels 32years after harvests of 15, 23 and 46m3ha−1 were 45%, 40%, and 24%, respectively. Net aboveground carbon increment for logged forests across all harvest intensities was 0.64MgCha−1yr−1, more than twice the rate observed in unlogged forests (0.26MgCha−1yr−1). The probabilities of timber stock recovery at the end of the 32-year period were highest after harvest intensities of 15 and 23m3ha−1 (with 80% probability) and lowest after the harvest of 46m3ha−1 (with 70% probability). Timber stock recovery across all harvest intensities was driven primarily by residual tree growth. Application of the legal cutting limit of 25m3ha−1 will require more than 70 and 40years to recover aboveground carbon and timber stocks, respectively, with 90% probability. Based on the low recruitment rates of the twelve species harvested, the 25year cutting cycle currently implemented in Suriname is too short for long-term timber stock sustainability. We highlight the value of propagating uncertainty from individual tree measurements to statistical predictions of carbon stock recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals the trade-offs that must be made between timber and carbon services as well as the opportunity to use carbon payments to enable longer cutting rotations to capture carbon from forest regrowth.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"246-255","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Reduced-impactlogging","Allometric models","Cutting cycles","REDD+","Sustainable forest management","Timber stocks"]},{"key":"ZXNJCNKY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2012","author":[{"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"G."},{"firstName":"Sabatier","lastName":" D."},{"firstName":"Blanc","lastName":" L."},{"firstName":"Chave","lastName":" J."},{"firstName":"Weissenbacher","lastName":" E."},{"firstName":"Pélissier","lastName":" R."},{"firstName":"Fonty","lastName":" E."},{"firstName":"Molino","lastName":" J. -F."},{"firstName":"Couteron","lastName":" P."}],"title":"Accuracy of small footprint airborne LiDAR in its predictions of tropical moist forest stand structure","publication_title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","issn":"0034-4257","doi":"10.1016/j.rse.2012.06.019","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425712002556","abstract_note":"We predict stand basal area (BA) from small footprint LiDAR data in 129 one-ha tropical forest plots across four sites in French Guiana and encompassing a great diversity of forest structures resulting from natural (soil and geological substrate) and anthropogenic effects (unlogged and logged forests).

Direct multiple regression was the most accurate, giving a 9.6% Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP). The magnitude of the various errors introduced during the data collection stage is evaluated and their contribution to MSEP is analyzed. It was found that these errors accounted for less than 10% of model MSEP, suggesting that there is considerable scope for model improvement. Although site-specific models showed lower MSEP than global models, stratification by site may not be the optimal solution.

This chapter summarizes the studies carried out to date aimed at estimating the potential impact of the projected GW by the end of this century on the Pantepui biota, particularly on vascular plants. The main threat seems to be extinction caused by habitat loss due to the impossibility of upward migration on the flat summits of the tepuis. Potential extinction has been estimated on the basis of GW predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) using the altitudinal range shift (ARS) and species–area relationship (SAR) methods. The preliminary results suggest the potential extinction of up to approximately 80% of the vascular flora, including approximately 50% of the Pantepui–endemic species. Several in situ and ex situ protection measures are discussed in an attempt to palliate such eventual biodiversity depletion. The available extinction estimates are preliminary and based on homogeneous responses of all vascular plants to GW, which is not fully realistic but is all that can be done with the available information. Future studies should be aimed at refining extinction estimates, considering the eventual idiosyncratic responses of the different species, such as differential migration rates, phenotypic plasticity, or adaptive ability. However, the main handicap is the lack of autoecological information on Pantepui species and the unfeasibility of conducting such studies due to the bureaucratic impediments related to obtaining sampling permits. It is urgent to circumvent this situation if the biodiversity of Pantepui, one of the very few pristine locations left on our planet, is to be preserved.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"403-417","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Globalwarming","acclimation","adaption","extinction","habitat loss","migration","plant responses"]},{"key":"3IPD3HVU","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Pinheiro","lastName":"Felipe M."},{"firstName":"Nair","lastName":" P.

With the increasing awareness about the role of carbon (C) storage in soils as a climate-change mitigation strategy and the relationship between the nature of soil aggregates and the soil's carbon sequestration potential, it is important to understand the influence of such SPS systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. We studied C content in three aggregate size classes in six land-use systems on Oxisols in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The systems were planted forest, native secondary forest, managed pasture, and three 8-year-old SPS, differing in their tree-planting configurations. Eucalyptus hybrid was the tree in SPS and planted forest treatments, and Urochloa decumbens was the grass in SPS and pasture treatments. From each treatment, replicated soil samples were collected from four depth-classes (0–10, 10–30, 30–60, and 60–100 cm), fractionated by wet sieving into the three aggregate-size classes, 2000 to 250 μm, 250 to 53 μm, and <53 μm size classes representing macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt + clay, respectively, and their C contents determined. Down to 1 m, total SOC stock values ranged from 260 Mg ha−1 under pasture to 167 Mg ha−1 under native forest, with 174 Mg ha−1 for Eucalyptus plantation and about 195 Mg ha−1 for the three SPS. Compared to the degraded native forest, the pasture system had significantly higher SOC in the whole soil and the aggregate size fractions, especially in the lower soil-depth classes. The lower SOC stock of Eucalyptus hybrid SPS compared to open pasture differs from the general trend of SPS having higher stock. Given that the Cerrado biome is a biodiversity hotspot, the use of native nitrogen-fixing trees, of which there are several, is worth investigating. In addition, the conversion from Eucalyptus monocultures to SPS could be considered as a strategy to increase the SOC stock.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"113676","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange mitigation","Carbon sequestration","Agroecosystems","Agroforestry"]},{"key":"JA7J5YVD","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Doiron","lastName":"Sébastien"},{"firstName":"Weissenberger","lastName":" Sebastian"}],"title":"Sustainable dive tourism: Social and environmental impacts — The case of Roatan, Honduras","publication_title":"Tourism Management Perspectives","issn":"2211-9736","doi":"10.1016/j.tmp.2013.12.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211973613000731","abstract_note":"The rapidly expanding coral diving tourism and the associated residential and commercial development exert a considerable pressure on the ecological and social fabric of Roatan, Honduras, and in particular on coral reefs and on mangroves.

Results show that a target temperature of 2°C dramatically reduces global CO2 emissions in the future. Under model parameters, by the end of this century, total global CO2 emissions will fall below 5 Gt, and cumulated CO2 emissions will be reduced to less than 1000 Gt. The key to meeting the 2°C target lies in the low-carbon transformation of energy and electricity systems. Implementation of climate policies and technical measures will progressively reduce conventional fossil energy consumption and replace it with low-carbon energy solutions. The electricity structure will gradually shift from dominance by conventional fossil energy to low-carbon energy, and even to zero-carbon electricity generation. We found that emission reduction pathways that include large amounts of fossil fuel power generation with CCS merely relying on subsidies may create higher GDP loss, but also that later penetration of negative emission technology can increase the carbon emission budget in the early stage.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"100063","language":"en","automatic_tags":["2°Ctarget","Electricity structure","Energy structure","Mitigation pathway","Negative emission technology"]},{"key":"9AIX8GFG","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Alizadeh","lastName":"Kamaleddin"},{"firstName":"Cohen","lastName":" Marcelo"},{"firstName":"Behling","lastName":" Hermann"}],"title":"Origin and dynamics of the northern South American coastal savanna belt during the Holocene – the role of climate, sea-level, fire and humans","publication_title":"Quaternary Science Reviews","issn":"0277-3791","doi":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2015.05.009","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379115002085","abstract_note":"Presence of a coastal savanna belt expanding from British Guiana to northeastern Brazil cannot be explained by present-day climate. Using pollen and charcoal analyses on an 11.6 k old sediment core from a coastal depression in the savanna belt near the mouth of the Amazon River we investigated the paleoenvironmental history to shed light on this question. Results indicate that small areas of savanna accompanied by a forest type composed primarily by the genus Micropholis (Sapotaceae) that has no modern analog existed at the beginning of the Holocene. After 11,200 cal yr BP, savanna accompanied by few trees replaced the forest. In depressions swamp forest developed and by ca 10,000 cal yr BP replaced by Mauritia swamps. Between 8500 and 5600 cal yr BP gallery forest (composed mainly of Euphorbiaceae) and swamp forest succeeded the treeless savanna. The modern vegetation with alternating gallery forest and savanna developed after 5600 cal yr BP. We suggest that the early Holocene no-analog forest is a relict of previously more extensive forest under cooler and moister Lateglacial conditions. The early Holocene savanna expansion indicates a drier phase probably related to the shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) towards its northernmost position. The mid-Holocene forest expansion is probably a result of the combined influence of equatorwards shift of ITCZ joining the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). The ecosystem variability during the last 5600 cal yr BP, formed perhaps under influence of intensified ENSO condition. High charcoal concentrations, especially during the early Holocene, indicate that natural and/or anthropogenic fires may have maintained the savanna. However, our results propose that climate change is the main driving factor for the formation of the coastal savanna in this region. Our results also show that the early Holocene sea level rise established mangroves near the study site until 7500 cal yr BP and promoted swamp formation in depressions, but did not influence the savanna vegetation.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"51-62","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Holocene","Vegetation change","Mangrove","Climate change","ENSO","Gallery forest","Human impact","ITCZ and SACZ shift","Pollen and charcoal analysis","Savanna"]},{"key":"9DLX6GRC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Leng","lastName":"Bing"},{"firstName":"Cao","lastName":" Kun-Fang"}],"title":"The sap flow of six tree species and stand water use of a mangrove forest in Hainan, China","publication_title":"Global Ecology and Conservation","issn":"2351-9894","doi":"10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01233","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989420307745","abstract_note":"Mangrove forests grow in coastal saline environments and, little is known about the stand water use (S) and regulation mechanisms of mangrove forests, particularly in the eastern mangrove group. We measured the xylem sap flow density (SFD) of six tree species for two years in a tropical mangrove forest on Hainan Island, China, which is under a monsoon climate. Bimodal daily SFD patterns were observed in all six species in spring and summer. The sap flow of all species were suppressed in winter strongly and also in spring. The annual water use per tree was positively correlated with diameter at breast height (DBH) (R2 = 0.81–0.89, P < 0.05). By scaling up from individual trees, we found that the S values of two mangrove plots ranged from 269.19 to 357.27 mm y−1 between the two study years, accounting for 18–22% of the annual rainfall. These S values are similar to those of other mangrove and tropical forests with similar stand basal areas.

Assessment of such GPP and NPP products can be valuable for understanding the efficacy of certain ESMs in simulating the global carbon cycle and future climate impacts. In this work, we studied the model performance of 22 ESMs participating in the fifth and sixth phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) by comparing historical GPP and NPP simulations with satellite data from MODIS and further evaluating potential model improvement from CMIP5 to CMIP6. In CMIP6, the average global total GPP and NPP estimated by the 22 ESMs are 16% and 13% higher than MODIS data, respectively. The multi-model ensembles (MME) of the 22 ESMs can fairly reproduce the spatial distribution, zonal distribution and seasonal variations of both GPP and NPP from MODIS. They perform much better in simulating GPP and NPP for grasslands, wetlands, croplands and other biomes than forests. However, there are noticeable differences among individual ESM simulations in terms of overall fluxes, temporal and spatial flux distributions, and fluxes by biome and region. The MME consistently outperforms all individual models in nearly every respect. Even though several ESMs have been improved in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5, there is still much work to be done to improve individual ESM and overall CMIP performance. Future work needs to focus on more comprehensive model mechanisms and parametrizations, higher resolution and more reasonable coupling of land surface schemes and atmospheric/oceanic schemes.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"152231","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Carbon cycle","CMIP5","CMIP6","Gross primary production","Net primary production"]},{"key":"PC3C8H6T","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Plath","lastName":"Mirco"},{"firstName":"Moser","lastName":" Christine"},{"firstName":"Bailis","lastName":" Rob"},{"firstName":"Brandt","lastName":" Patric"},{"firstName":"Hirsch","lastName":" Heidi"},{"firstName":"Klein","lastName":" Alexandra-Maria"},{"firstName":"Walmsley","lastName":" David"},{"firstName":"von Wehrden","lastName":" Henrik"}],"title":"A novel bioenergy feedstock in Latin America?

The neotropical palm Acrocomia aculeata is currently being promoted as a novel sustainable biomass feedstock, particularly for bioenergy, but only little is known about the palm’s ecological requirements. Based on a comprehensive literature and database search for recorded occurrences of A. aculeata in Latin America, we computed an ecological niche modeling to determine the palm’s potential distribution area based on climatic and soil variables. We subsequently considered current land cover and predicted future climate change scenarios to discuss the cultivation potential of A. aculeata within its possible distribution area. The results revealed a large potential to cultivate A. aculeata in Latin America under current abiotic environmental conditions. The two core distribution regions identified were (1) Central America including the Caribbean, northern Colombia and Venezuela, and (2) southern Brazil and eastern Paraguay. A considerable proportion of the medium to highly suitable growing areas were found to be currently used for agricultural production or covered by land types with high conservation and carbon sequestration value. Applying the model under the IPCC’s A2A ‘business as usual’ emission scenario suggested that by 2080 the vast majority of suitable growing areas severely decline in extent or disappear entirely. Our ecological niche modeling thus shows that despite the palm’s high cultivation potential, a sustainable deployment of A. aculeata requires a precautious, evidence-based approach.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"186-195","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Sustainability","Biofuel","Ecological niche modeling","Macaúba","Macaw palm"]},{"key":"Z9FS6A5I","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Acevedo","lastName":"Sebastian"},{"firstName":"Mrkaic","lastName":" Mico"},{"firstName":"Novta","lastName":" Natalija"},{"firstName":"Pugacheva","lastName":" Evgenia"},{"firstName":"Topalova","lastName":" Petia"}],"title":"The Effects of Weather Shocks on Economic Activity: What are the Channels of Impact?","publication_title":"Journal of Macroeconomics","issn":"0164-0704","doi":"10.1016/j.jmacro.2020.103207","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164070420301336","abstract_note":"Global temperatures have increased at a historically unprecedented pace.

The proper evaluation of this role depends on a clear understanding of sea surface temperature (SST) variations during AMOC slowdown periods like Heinrich Stadials (HS) in the western tropical Atlantic. However, published SST records from the western tropical Atlantic between ca. 4°S and 7°N show inconsistencies that are apparently related to the employed temperature proxy (i.e., Mg/Ca versus alkenone unsaturation index U37k′). In general, while Mg/Ca values indicate warming during Heinrich Stadials, U37k′ values show cooling. To assess this issue, we sampled core GeoB16224-1 retrieved off French Guiana (i.e., 6°39.38′N) and reconstructed water temperatures at high resolution using Mg/Ca on the foraminifera species Globigerinoides ruber, U37k′, TEX86 and modern analogue technique (MAT) transfer functions using planktonic foraminifera assemblages calibrated for 50 m water depth. Our results show that Mg/Ca and TEX86 values recorded an increase in SST related to AMOC slowdown. Conversely, U37k′ and MAT values registered a decrease in temperatures during HS3 and HS1. Our U37k′ and Mg/Ca results thus confirm the previously reported inconsistency for the period between 48–13 cal ka BP. We suggest that several non-thermal physiological effects probably imparted a negative temperature bias on the U37k′ temperatures during Heinrich Stadials. However, MAT-based temperatures show similar variability with U37k′-based temperatures. Hence, we also suggest that during severe slowdown periods of the AMOC, a steeper meridional temperature gradient together with a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergent Zone produced not only an increase in SST but also a stronger upper water column stratification and a shoaling of the thermocline, decreasing subsurface temperatures. Our new high resolution temperature records allow a better characterization of the thermal response of the upper water column in the tropical western Atlantic to slowdown events of the AMOC, reconciling previously discrepant records.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"120-129","language":"en","automatic_tags":["HeinrichStadials","Mg/Ca","modern analogue technique","tropical Atlantic"]},{"key":"LPWTM4GW","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Victoria J."},{"firstName":"Ferrari","lastName":" Stephen F."}],"title":"Assessment and management of the North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem","publication_title":"Environmental Development","issn":"2211-4645","doi":"10.1016/j.envdev.2016.11.004","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211464516302317","abstract_note":"The North Brazil Shelf is a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that extends from the Caribbean Sea, in Central America, to the Parnaiba River in Brazil, and includes six countries. The area is dominated by the runoff of large rivers, including the Amazon and Orinoco, and by the intense disturbance of sediment transport, tides and currents. The sea bed is formed mainly by mud in shallow water, and by sand, mud, and gravel in deeper water. In terms of its biological productivity, this LME can be considered oligotrophic, with stratified habitats. The main source of nutrients of the euphotic layer is the local rivers and mangroves. Primary production has been limited by light and rising temperatures in recent years, factors associated with a decrease in marine primary productivity. However, the benthic fauna is very rich and unique, but poorly known. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in this LME. Demersal fish and shrimp are the main fishery resources in coastal and continental shelf waters. Fisheries account for more than 600 million USD a year with a considerable diversity of methods and scales ranging from very small to industrial. Seafood consumption is moderate to high in the local countries. Climate changes, dam building, deforestation, pollution, overfishing, tourism and aquaculture are the main threats to ecosystem productivity and habitat quality. Socioeconomic data are scant for this LME. Development is concentrated near the cities and mouths of rivers. Traditional communities in the coastal areas are culturally diverse, but invariably characterized by very low socioeconomic conditions. The Gross Domestic Product of the local countries ranges from 7,500 USD per capita in Guyana to 32,600 USD per capita in Trinidad and Tobago. Profound problems of governability are common to all six countries, and mean governance indicators reflect poor performances in all cases. The main issues are an absence of effective rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption. Fisheries are characterized by increasing effort and an absence of sustainability. Most of the fishery stocks are either fully or over exploited. This scenario can only be rectified by investments in marine protected areas and scientific research, as well as the increased participation of fishers in the development and implementation of management strategies and regulations.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"97-110","language":"en","automatic_tags":["EcosystemBased Management","Fisheries","Governance"]},{"key":"VF9AP5TE","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Bousfield","lastName":"Christopher G."},{"firstName":"Cerullo","lastName":" Gianluca R."},{"firstName":"Massam","lastName":" Mike R."},{"firstName":"Edwards","lastName":" David P."}],"title":"Chapter One - Protecting environmental and socio-economic values of selectively logged tropical forests in the Anthropocene","publication_title":"Advances in Ecological Research","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065250420300064","abstract_note":"Global timber demands have penetrated vast tracts of tropical rainforest, with selective logging the most powerful driver of human disturbance within these ecosystems.

Selectively logged forests maintain a wide array of ecosystem services, and orders of magnitude higher levels of biodiversity and carbon storage than the agricultural lands that often imperil them. To unlock the full potential of logged forests in conserving biodiversity, tackling climate change and delivering ecosystem services into the Anthropocene will require several major transitions. These include a pantropical shift towards more environmentally sensitive logging practises, the fostering of new norms in tropical forestry based around long-term forest management, as well as coordinated efforts to limit the negative effects of logging roads, illegal logging and climate change. We discuss potential incentive and enforcement-based mechanisms for precipitating such transitions and highlight key avenues for future enquiry. Research frontiers include determining how best to spatially design logging operations to limit environmental impacts, quantifying the costs and benefits of post-logging activities aimed at recovering logged forest values, and investigating the role of concession licence structures in spawning sustainable forest management.

We exhaustively reviewed any published and unpublished study on fruiting phenology carried out at the community level in the American tropics and subtropics (latitudinal range: 26°N–26°S) to (1) provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of fruiting phenology research throughout the Neotropics; (2) unravel the climatic factors that have been widely reported as drivers of fruiting phenology; and (3) provide a preliminary assessment of the potential phenological responses of plants under future climatic scenarios. Despite the large number of phenological datasets uncovered (218), our review shows that their geographic distribution is very uneven and insufficient for the large surface of the Neotropics (~1 dataset per ~78,000km2). Phenological research is concentrated in few areas with many studies (state of São Paulo, Brazil, and Costa Rica), whereas vast regions elsewhere are entirely unstudied. Sampling effort in fruiting phenology studies was generally low: the majority of datasets targeted fewer than 100 plant species (71%), lasted 2years or less (72%), and only 10.4% monitored >15 individuals per species. We uncovered only 10 sites with ten or more years of phenological monitoring. The ratio of numbers of species sampled to overall estimates of plant species richness was wholly insufficient for highly diverse vegetation types such as tropical rainforest, seasonal forest and cerrado, and only slightly more robust for less diverse vegetation types, such as deserts, arid shrublands and open grassy savannas. Most plausible drivers of phenology extracted from these datasets were environmental (78.5%), whereas biotic drivers were rare (6%). Among climatic factors, rainfall was explicitly included in 73.4% of cases, followed by air temperature (19.3%). Other environmental cues such as water level (6%), solar radiation or photoperiod (3.2%), and ENSO events (1.4%) were rarely addressed. In addition, drivers were analyzed statistically in only 38% of datasets and techniques were basically correlative, with only 4.8% of studies including any consideration of the inherently autocorrelated character of phenological time series. Fruiting peaks were significantly more often reported during the rainy season both in rainforests and cerrado woodlands, which is at odds with the relatively aseasonal character of the former vegetation type. Given that climatic models predict harsh future conditions for the tropics, we urgently need to determine the magnitude of changes in plant reproductive phenology and distinguish those from cyclical oscillations. Long-term monitoring and herbarium data are therefore key for detecting these trends. Our review shows that the unevenness in geographic distribution of studies, and diversity of sampling methods, vegetation types, and research motivation hinder the emergence of clear general phenological patterns and drivers for the Neotropics. We therefore call for prioritizing research in unexplored areas, and improving the quantitative component and statistical design of reproductive phenology studies to enhance our predictions of climate change impacts on tropical plants and animals.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"227-241","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Tropics","America","Frugivore","Fruit and seed production"]},{"key":"XKYF4G3N","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Starolis","lastName":"Meghan W."},{"firstName":"Perez","lastName":" Omar"},{"firstName":"Powell","lastName":" Eleanor A."}],"title":"Clinical features and laboratory diagnosis of emerging arthropod-transmitted viruses: A Report from the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology Clinical Practice Committee","publication_title":"Journal of Clinical Virology","issn":"1386-6532","doi":"10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104651","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220303930","abstract_note":"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are an increasing global threat due to their ability to cause human disease and their expanding geographical distribution.

We model the extinction risks for a tropical heliothermic teiid lizard (Kentropyx calcarata) integrating previously obtained information on intraspecific phylogeographic structure, eco-physiological traits and contemporary species distributions in the Amazon rainforest and its ecotone to the Cerrado savannah. We also investigated how thermal-biology traits vary throughout the species' geographic range and the consequences of such variation for lineage vulnerability. We show substantial variation in thermal tolerance of individuals among thermally distinct sites. Thermal critical limits were highly correlated with operative environmental temperatures. Our physiological/climatic model predicted relative extinction risks for local populations within clades of K. calcarata for 2050 ranging between 26.1% and 70.8%, while for 2070, extinction risks ranged from 52.8% to 92.8%. Our results support the hypothesis that tropical-lizard taxa are at high risk of local extinction caused by increasing temperatures. However, the thermo-physiological differences found across the species' distribution suggest that local adaptation may allow persistence of this tropical ectotherm in global warming scenarios. These results will serve as basis to further research to investigate the strength of local adaptation to climate change. Persistence of Kentropyx calcarata also depends on forest preservation, but the Amazon rainforest is currently under high deforestation rates. We argue that higher conservation priority is necessary so the Amazon rainforest can fulfill its capacity to absorb the impacts of temperature increase on tropical ectotherms during climate change.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"50-60","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Globalwarming","Amazon","Cerrado","Ecophysiology","Performance","Preferred temperature"]},{"key":"XSMFMPS4","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2013","author":[{"firstName":"VanWormer","lastName":"Elizabeth"},{"firstName":"Fritz","lastName":" Heather"},{"firstName":"Shapiro","lastName":" Karen"},{"firstName":"Mazet","lastName":" Jonna A.

The objectives of this study were: i) to identify the countries and regions with the highest number of fire foci in SA, and ii) to evaluate the spatial dynamics of fire foci based on the Meteorological Fire Danger Index (MFDI) and future scenarios through numerical simulations. Fire foci time series comprised 21 years (1998–2018) from the BDQueimadas database. Cluster Analysis (CA), descriptive and exploratory statistics were employed. Fire foci maps for SA were made in 10-km pixel dimensions. MFDI was used to assess fire danger via SPEEDY (Simplified Parametrizations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics) model simulations. Three simulations were performed: control scenario (1980–2015), RCP2.6 scenario (optimistic - 2016 and 2050), and RCP8.5 scenario (pessimistic - 2015 and 2050). Regionally, three homogeneous groups of fire foci (G1, G2 and G3) and one atypical (NA - Not Grouped) were identified for Brazil via CA. The highest fire foci occurred in Brazil (62.72%), followed by Bolivia (9.03%), Argentina (8.28%), Venezuela (6.11%), Paraguay (5.94%), and Colombia (3.87%), respectively. The highest density of fire foci occurred in the MATOPIBA region, the confluence of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí, and Bahia, - (agricultural frontier), and also in the Cerrado-Amazon transition and the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil, followed by Paraguay, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Argentina. The countries and regions of Brazil do not change, only intensify from year to year, and such fire foci variability may be associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases. The control scenario identified in east-central Brazil, western Bolivia, Paraguay, and northern Argentina.

These environments face a major crisis due to increased deforestation, pollution, and climate change, emphasizing the need for more effective conservation efforts. The adequate monitoring of these ecosystems has proven a complex and time consuming endeavour, which depends on ever dwindling taxonomic expertise. To date, many species remain undiscovered, let alone described, with otherwise limited information regarding known species population distributions and densities. Overcoming these knowledge shortfalls and practical limitations is becoming increasingly possible through techniques based on environmental DNA (eDNA), i.e., DNA that can be obtained from environmental samples (e.g. tissues, soil, sediment, water, etc.). When coupled with high-throughput sequencing, these techniques now enable realistic, cost-effective, and standardisable biodiversity assessments. This opens up enormous opportunities for advancing our understanding of complex and species-rich tropical communities, but also in facilitating large-scale biomonitoring programs in the neotropics. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to eDNA methods, and an overview of their current and potential uses in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of neotropical rainforests. We also discuss the limits and challenges of these methods for our understanding and monitoring of biodiversity, as well as future research and applied perspectives of these techniques in neotropical rainforests, and beyond.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"331-373","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Neotropics","Rainforests","Biomonitoring","Conservation biology","DNA metabarcoding","eDNA","Environmental genomics"]},{"key":"HTKA6SH9","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Yguel","lastName":"Benjamin"},{"firstName":"Piponiot","lastName":" Camille"},{"firstName":"Mirabel","lastName":" Ariane"},{"firstName":"Dourdain","lastName":" Aurelie"},{"firstName":"Hérault","lastName":" Bruno"},{"firstName":"Gourlet-Fleury","lastName":" Sylvie"},{"firstName":"Forget","lastName":" Pierre-Michel"},{"firstName":"Fontaine","lastName":" Colin"}],"title":"Beyond species richness and biomass: Impact of selective logging and silvicultural treatments on the functional composition of a neotropical forest","publication_title":"Forest Ecology and Management","issn":"0378-1127","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2018.11.022","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112718314944","abstract_note":"Tropical forests harbor the greatest terrestrial biodiversity and provide various ecosystem services. The increase of human activities on these forests, among which logging, makes the conservation of biodiversity and associated services strongly dependent on the sustainability of these activities. However the indicators commonly used to assess the impact of forest exploitation, namely species richness and biomass, provide a limited understanding of their sustainability. Here, we assessed the sustainability of common forest exploitation in the Guiana Shield studying the recovery of two ecosystem services i.e. carbon storage and wood stock, and an ecosystem function i.e. seed dispersal by animals. Specifically, we compared total and commercial biomass, as well as functional composition in seed size of animal-dispersed species in replicated forest plots before and 27 years after exploitation. Species richness is also studied to allow comparison. While species richness was not affected by forest exploitation, total and commercial biomass as well as seed size of animal-dispersed species decreased 27 years after exploitation, similarly to forests affected by hunting. These results show that ecosystem services and function likely did not recover even at the lowest intensity of forest exploitation studied, questioning the sustainability of the most common rotation-cycle duration applied in the tropics.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"528-534","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Selectivelogging","Sustainability","Anthropogenic pressure","Carbon storage","Commercial stock","Functional composition","Humid tropical forest","Seed dispersal"]},{"key":"4RIP99YV","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Montoya","lastName":"Encarni"},{"firstName":"Pedra-Méndez","lastName":" Jordi"},{"firstName":"García-Falcó","lastName":" Esther"},{"firstName":"Gómez-Paccard","lastName":" Miriam"},{"firstName":"Giralt","lastName":" Santiago"},{"firstName":"Vegas-Vilarrúbia","lastName":" Teresa"},{"firstName":"Stauffer","lastName":" Fred W."},{"firstName":"Rull","lastName":" Valentí"}],"title":"Long-term vegetation dynamics of a tropical megadelta: Mid-Holocene palaeoecology of the Orinoco Delta (NE Venezuela)","publication_title":"Quaternary Science Reviews","issn":"0277-3791","doi":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.105874","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027737911930561X","abstract_note":"Coastal wetlands have been proposed as highly threatened by the ongoing and future climatic change, including projected sea-level changes as an additional forcing factor compared to more inland locations. The limited knowledge generated to date in this topic has been primarily focused on those areas attaining a high population density, and rarely deals with long-term (>50 years) dynamics. Here we present the first Holocene palaeoecological study carried in the Orinoco Delta, in NE Venezuela. The record presented here contains sediments from the last 6200 years and is located in a river-shore swamp dominated by the palm Mauritia flexuosa. Current human occupation is almost restricted to small settlements of the Warao indigenous culture, closely related to the use of M. flexuosa and other palm species present in the zone. The results show the occurrence of three well-distinguished palynological zones: (i) from 6200 to 5200 cal yr BP, characterised by mixed rainforest and other taxa related to salinity (coastal-like), low (negative) values of magnetic susceptibility and magnetic grain size, absence of transported clays, and the highest macrocharcoal particles abundance; (ii) from 5200 to 2950 cal yr BP, marked by a replacement of the mangrove-like vegetation by a more inland mixed-swamp forest community with low levels of charcoal, and (iii) from 2950 cal yr BP to present-day, characterised by the establishment of the current vegetation community, dominated by M. flexuosa, and an increasing trend in the charcoal curve since the last 700 years. A combination of regional (climatic changes) and local (sediment ontogeny) has been proposed as the key drivers influencing the vegetation succession recorded. The stabilisation of the sea-level that occurred during the mid-Holocene would have favoured the transgression of the coastal line, with the migration of the coastal-like vegetation seawards. Synchronous to this event, a trend towards drier conditions has been reported in the close Cariaco record, that could have also influenced the vegetation replacement. Between 3800 and 2800 years ago, the increased ENSO variability registered in Cariaco may have played a key role in the expansion of the Mauritia palm community. It is suggested that in our location, the potential inhabiting human populations were differently influenced by these environmental changes. First, the disappearance of the coastal resources could have favoured land abandonment, whereas the increase in the abundance of the palm might be influential for the arrival of other inland cultures that were previously used to manage Mauritia. This sequence shows the importance of the ecosystem services for the location inhabitants, highlighting the abandonment of the mid-Holocene culture coeval with the disappearance of its ecosystem. These results also provide information about the sensitivity and resilience in facing external stressors of both humans and vegetation, and will be valuable tools for managing the future of this ecosystem.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"105874","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Fire","Indigenous cultures","Sea-level changes","Soils ontogeny"]},{"key":"FNVVS3ER","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Orme","lastName":"A.

In the humid tropics like the Amazonia biome, carbon inputs from agrosystems are rarely quantified and described, despite their major contribution to the SOC dynamics after deforestation. We assessed SOC dynamics with repeated measurements in the layer 0–30cm until five years after deforestation in a diachronic site in French Guiana, cleared with a fire-free method associated to large woody debris inputs. Three agrosystems were studied: one year maize/soybean rotation with disk tillage (DT) and without tillage (NT), and a mowed grassland (G). Aboveground carbon inputs from agrosystems were measured. In addition to SOC stocks assessment, we measured roots carbon stocks, and performed δ13C measurements in grassland soil. We found a transient SOC stock increase until 1.5 years after deforestation because of large woody debris inputs from deforestation method, but these C inputs were rapidly mineralized and poorly contributed to SOC stocks 5 years after deforestation. SOC stocks in grassland did not differ from forest despite large hay exports. Thanks to large root-derived carbon inputs, C4-SOC stock in grassland was 10.4tha−1 5 years after deforestation (18.7% of the SOC stock). In annual crops, 5 years after deforestation, SOC stocks decreased on average by 18.6% compared to forest. SOC stocks did not differ according to soil tillage since aboveground carbon inputs were similar in DT and NT systems. Lower SOC stocks in annual crops compared to grassland is explained by lower carbon restitutions and by higher mineralization rate of organic matter.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"63-73","language":"en","automatic_tags":["FrenchGuiana","Soil organic matter","Agro-ecosystem management","Land-use change","Tillage","Tropical soils"]},{"key":"MFQC8N9Q","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Confalonieri","lastName":"Ulisses E.

Each species of mangrove (but particularly those belonging to the genera Rhizophora, Bruguiera, Sonneratia, Heritiera and Nypa) occurs in ecological conditions that approach its limit of tolerance with regard to salinity of the water and soil, as well as the inundation regime. If the duration of daily immersion were to be modified by tectonic, sedimentological or hydrological events, the species either readjusts to the new conditions or succumbs to unsuitable conditions.

Cambial dynamics of P. latteri and P. kesiya in subtropical Thailand were studied for two consecutive growing seasons. We observed that monthly rainfall, relative humidity, soil moisture, monthly minimum temperature, and monthly mean temperature were positively related to the number of cambial cell layers and cambial zone width. Moisture in the late dry season and in the beginning of the rainy season was very important in stimulating cambial cell division after a long-term moisture deficit for more than three months. The growth responses to climate in a 128-year-long chronology of P. latteri and an 88-year-long chronology of P. kesiya were similar. Importantly, the amount of rainfall and relative humidity in April and May had positive effects on the tree-ring widths of both pine species. On the other hand, both mean monthly maximum temperature and mean monthly temperature had negative effects on tree-ring widths. P. kesiya is more susceptible to drought, as shown by its correlation with the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index.

We aimed to estimate the risk and number of people infected with A lumbricoides, T trichiura, and hookworm across South America. Methods We did a systematic review of reports on the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection in South America published up to May 14, 2012. We extracted and georeferenced relevant survey data and did a meta-analysis of the data to assess the geographical distribution of the infection risk with Bayesian geostatistical models.

Findings We screened 4085 scientific papers and identified 174 articles containing relevant survey prevalence data. We georeferenced 6948 survey locations and entered the data into the open-access Global Neglected Tropical Diseases database. Survey data were sparse for the south of the continent and for the western coast, and we identified no relevant information for Uruguay and little data for smaller countries such as Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, and Ecuador. Population-adjusted prevalence of infection with A lumbricoides was 15·6%, with T trichiura was 12·5%, and with hookworm was 11·9% from 2005 onwards. Risks of contracting soil-transmitted helminth infection have substantially reduced since 2005 (odds ratio 0·47 [95% Bayesian credible interval 0·46–0·47] for A lumbricoides, 0·54 [0·54–0·55] for T trichiura, and 0·58 [0·58–0·59] for hookworm infection). Interpretation Our findings offer important baseline support for spatial targeting of soil-transmitted helminthiasis control, and suggest that more information about the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection is needed, especially in countries in which we estimate prevalence of infection to be high but for which current data are scarce.

Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and implement large-scale networks to monitor trends in bat populations over extended time periods. Using data from a range of Neotropical and Paleotropical bat assemblages, we assessed the ability for long-term monitoring programs to reliably detect temporal trends in species abundance. We explored the magnitude of within-site temporal variation in abundance and evaluated the statistical power of a suite of different sampling designs for several different bat species and ensembles. Despite pronounced temporal variation in abundance of most tropical bat species, power simulations suggest that long-term monitoring programs (⩾20years) can detect population trends of 5% per year or more with adequate statistical power (⩾0.9). However, shorter monitoring programs (⩽10years) have insufficient power for trend detection. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that a monitoring program extending over 20years with four surveys conducted biennially on five plots per monitoring site would have the potential for detecting a 5% annual change in abundance for a suite of bat species from different ensembles. The likelihood of reaching adequate statistical power was sensitive to initial species abundance and the magnitude of count variation, stressing that only the most abundant species in an assemblage and those with generally low variation in abundance should be considered for detailed population monitoring.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"2797-2807","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Chiroptera","Biodiversity monitoring","Population decline","Population trends","Power analysis","Sampling design"]},{"key":"C78WB6SC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yancheng"},{"firstName":"Chiessi","lastName":" Cristiano M."},{"firstName":"Mulitza","lastName":" Stefan"},{"firstName":"Zabel","lastName":" Matthias"},{"firstName":"Trindade","lastName":" Ricardo I.

At least two types of kaolinite were identified in the Oxisol; near the surface, the kaolinite is less fractionated and was developed at a higher temperature (35°C). This is probably due to the effect of vegetation and/or evapotranspiration or is a consequence of surface microenvironmental conditions or allochthonous inputs. The other kaolinite samples ranged in formation temperatures from 21°C to 26°C and developed under conditions similar to the Pleistocene and the modern climate of Amazonia. At least two types of gibbsite were found. One type developed in the modern Amazonia climate, in a way similar to most kaolinite samples, whereas the samples of the other type are more fractionated. This is because they may have been formed in low recycling rainwater and/or under a low amount of precipitation. These two conditions indicate a seasonal climate for bauxite development that can be linked to the low exhumation of the Andes cordillera and its geographical position relative to the Trombetas region during the period ranging from the Late Oligocene to the Early Miocene. At the end of the Cenozoic, the climate was less seasonal and wetter and the temperature was lower In addition, there was the probable inland position of the Trombetas region, which allowed Oxisol development. The gibbsite developed earlier than the kaolinite of the Oxisol, but there is a partial inheritance, or temporal equivalence, among the bauxite horizon and the Oxisol, as well as multiple generations of gibbsite and kaolinite, which is to be expected for materials developing over long periods in hard leaching conditions.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"178-184","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Bauxite","Climate changes","Lateritization process","Oxisol"]},{"key":"3C8KPE3P","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Pereira","lastName":"Ryan"},{"firstName":"Bovolo","lastName":" C.

Our 3 years of data capture a reduced rainfall regime in 2009 and an extended wet season in 2010, in contrast to the widely documented Amazonian floods in 2009 and droughts in 2010. Comparisons of observed precipitation with satellite derived TRMM and ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis precipitation show that both of these data sets capture the general pattern of seasonality, but substantially underestimate rainfall amounts in the primary wet season (by up to 50% and 72% respectively). The TRMM dataset is generally better at characterising the main dry season from September to December but the ERA-Interim model can overestimate precipitation in the dry season by up to 175%. Our new data on isotopic chemistry of river waters show that δ2H/δ18O values in this region are broadly consistent with interpolated global datasets of modelled precipitation isotopic signatures. The dominance of isotopically lighter water derived from the rains of the ITCZ during the wet season provides evidence of the close coupling of water chemistry of headwater rivers on the northern rim of Amazonia to the positioning of the ITCZ over the region. Our results highlight the challenge in understanding and representing local scale hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics using regional scale model data. We argue that combining point and local scale field data with larger scale model data is necessary to progress towards a comprehensive understanding of climate–hydrology interactions in Amazonia.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"108-118","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Guyana","Climate","ERA-Interim","Hydrology","Iwokrama","TRMM"]},{"key":"5U5YT5RH","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2011","author":[{"firstName":"Pickles","lastName":"R.

We found high levels of mtDNA haplotype diversity (h=0.93 overall) and support for subdivision into four distinct groups of populations, representing important centers of genetic diversity and useful units for prioritizing conservation within the giant otter. We tested these results against the predictions of three hypotheses of Amazonian diversification (Pleistocene Refugia, Paleogeography, and Hydrogeology). While the phylogeographic pattern conformed to the predictions of the Refugia Hypothesis, molecular dating using a relaxed clock revealed the phylogroups diverged from one another between 1.69 and 0.84Ma, ruling out the influence of Late Pleistocene glacial refugia. However, the role of Plio-Pleistocene climate change could not be rejected. While the molecular dating also makes the influence of geological arches according to the Paleogeography Hypothesis extremely unlikely, the recent Pliocene formation of the Fitzcarrald Arch and its effect of subsequently altering drainage pattern could not be rejected. The data presented here support the interactions of both climatic and hydrological changes resulting from geological activity in the Plio-Pleistocene, in shaping the phylogeographic structure of the giant otter.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"616-627","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazonia","Conservation units","Mitochondrial DNA","Paleodrainage","Phylogeography","Refugia"]},{"key":"NG862GS5","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2004","author":[{"firstName":"Kamel","lastName":"Stephanie Jill"},{"firstName":"Mrosovsky","lastName":" N."}],"title":"Nest site selection in leatherbacks, Dermochelys coriacea: individual patterns and their consequences","publication_title":"Animal Behaviour","issn":"0003-3472","doi":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.07.021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347204001265","abstract_note":"We determined individual nest placement patterns for female leatherbacks nesting at Awa:la-Ya:lima:po, French Guiana, by measuring distance from the nest to several landscape features, such as the highest spring tide line (HSTL) and the vegetation line. Distance from the nest to the HSTL differed significantly between females, indicating the existence of individual nesting patterns. There was a significant repeatability of nest site choice relative to the HSTL, indicating that females showed within-individual consistency in their nest placement. Despite individual preferences, there was much within-individual variation and a lack of predictability in the nesting patterns; that is, the locations of subsequent nests could not be predicted based on knowledge of previous nest choices, indicating a certain degree of scatter. The significant repeatability suggests that nest choice behaviour in female leatherbacks is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. We tested sea-finding ability of hatchlings, a potential consequence of nest site choice, in Matapica, Suriname, by using orientation arenas to quantify the strength and direction of travel after emergence. The orientation tests showed that hatchlings were unable to move seaward in vegetated arenas, providing evidence that vegetation acts as a strong selective pressure driving nest placement seaward. It appears that leatherbacks have adopted a regional rather than a local optimum for nest placement patterns, possibly resulting from their weak beach fidelity and the frequent erosion and destruction of their nesting beaches. We discuss the evolutionary and conservation implications for this species in the context of current environmental changes.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"357-366","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"Y8QKGFUW","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Mitoulis","lastName":"Stergios Aristoteles"},{"firstName":"Argyroudis","lastName":" Sotirios A"},{"firstName":"Loli","lastName":" Marianna"},{"firstName":"Imam","lastName":" Boulent"}],"title":"Restoration models for quantifying flood resilience of bridges","publication_title":"Engineering Structures","issn":"0141-0296","doi":"10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112180","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141029621003308","abstract_note":"Bridges are the most vulnerable assets of our transport networks. They are disproportionately exposed to and hit by multiple natural hazards, with flooding being the leading cause of bridge failures in the world. Their performance is constantly challenged by the combined effects of natural hazard stressors, e.g. flash floods, exacerbated by climate change, ageing, increasing traffic volumes and loads. Bridges are vulnerable to scour and other flood-related impacts, such as hydraulic forces and debris accumulation. In order to assess and quantify the resilience of flood-critical bridges and subsequently deploy bridge resilience models aiming at building resilience into transport networks, it is essential to use reliable fragility, capacity restoration and traffic reinstatement metrics and models. It is surprising that, despite the importance of bridges and their high vulnerability to hydraulic actions, there are no available recovery models. The latter can help quantify the pace of post-flood capacity and functionality gain for facilitating well-informed decision making for reliable prioritisation and efficient allocation of resources in transport networks. The main barrier is the nature and complexity of recovery actions, which encompass engineering, operational, owner resources and organisational challenges, among others. This paper, for the first time in the international literature, aims at filling this gap by generating a set of reliable recovery models that include both bridge reinstatement (traffic capacity) and restoration (structural capacity) models based on a detailed questionnaire that elicits knowledge from experts. Recovery models are then presented and validated for spread and deep foundations for a typical reinforced concrete bridge, including restoration task prioritisation and scheduling, inter-task dependencies, idle times, durations and cost ratios for different damage levels, as well as the evolution of traffic capacity after floods.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"112180","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Resilience","Bridge","Cost ratio","Damage levels","Elicitation Survey","Flood","Functionality loss","Idle time","Reinstatement","Restoration","Scour","SDGs 9, 11, 13","Transport infrastructure"]},{"key":"RAF2R75C","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Nakamura","lastName":"Akihiro"},{"firstName":"Kitching","lastName":" Roger L."},{"firstName":"Cao","lastName":" Min"},{"firstName":"Creedy","lastName":" Thomas J."},{"firstName":"Fayle","lastName":" Tom M."},{"firstName":"Freiberg","lastName":" Martin"},{"firstName":"Hewitt","lastName":" C.

Despite the high frequency in marginalized populations, little information is available on the geography and estimates of the population at risk in endemic regions. Here we used a geostatistical model to map the potential geographic distribution of areas suitable for tungiasis transmission in Latin America and estimated the at-risk population. Methods We developed an ecological niche model (ENM) using tungiasis occurrence records and remotely sensed environmental and socioeconomic data. The potential geographic distribution was then compared to the current population distribution of the region to derive the total population living in urban and rural areas. Findings We identified a total of 138 records of occurrences of tungiasis in Latin America, ranging from Mexico to Argentina; 27 reports were not included in the modeling, due to missing detailed geographic information. The occurrences with detailed geographic information (n = 112) included 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The locations were in environments that primarily consisted of forests (29%), croplands (16•5%), and shrublands (10•9%). We predicted environmentally suitable areas for tungiasis transmission in 45 countries. The estimated human population living in these areas is 450,546,547 with urban centers accounting for 347,007,103 and rural areas 103,539,444.

We show that these resources have great synergetic potential for displacing fossil fuel-based power generation. Flexible operation of the Afobaka hydropower plant, newly in full possession of Suriname, allows significant wind power integration without violating grid stability and associated power quality requirements. Considering the trade-off between displacing expensive fossil fuels and limiting wind power curtailment on Suriname's island-like grid, our results suggest that integrating wind power in the Surinamese electricity mix is economically advantageous up to a share of 20–30%, independently of near-term demand growth.

Slope failure occurred at different periods (Cretaceous to Neogene) and shows an overall retrogressive evolution through time. Upslope these failure headscarp, an enigmatic regional Mio-Pliocene unconformity has been discovered through the interpretation of new academic and industrial datasets. The aim of this work is to describe and understand the origin of this surface. Our analysis shows that this unconformity is made of a series of valleys that cross-cut sedimentary strata. Each one of these valleys has a short lateral extent and is closed along two perpendicular directions, which suggests that it could correspond to a highly meandering system, or to some sub-circular depressions. The infill of these features is equivalent to the regional stratigraphic strata found outside the structures, but in a subdued position. This seems to imply that the structures have originated by a local loss of sediments at their base or by sliding processes. Furthermore, these depressions intersect each other through time, while migrating progressively downslope. We discuss a series of hypotheses that try to explain the onset and evolution of these depressions forming the Mio-Pliocene unconformity (Canyons? Slope failures? Contourite moats? Hydrate pockmarks?). Having established that these structures are depressions formed by collapse, and have many similarities with structures recently described in the literature as pockmarks associated with gas hydrate dissolution, we favor this hypothesis. We propose that these hydrate pockmarks form with a mass failure that was triggered by fluid-overpressure development at the base of the hydrate stability zone.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"21-35","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Contourite","Demerara plateau","Canyon","Hydrate pockmark","Slide","Unconformity","Valley"]},{"key":"UDKFKAA2","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Boscaini","lastName":"Andrea"},{"firstName":"Marzoli","lastName":" Andrea"},{"firstName":"Bertrand","lastName":" Hervé"},{"firstName":"Chiaradia","lastName":" Massimo"},{"firstName":"Jourdan","lastName":" Fred"},{"firstName":"Faccenda","lastName":" Manuele"},{"firstName":"Meyzen","lastName":" Christine M."},{"firstName":"Callegaro","lastName":" Sara"},{"firstName":"Serrano Durán","lastName":" Lina"}],"title":"Cratonic keels controlled the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP)","publication_title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","issn":"0012-821X","doi":"10.1016/j.epsl.2022.117480","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X22001169","abstract_note":"Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are exceptionally voluminous magmatic events frequently related to continental break-up, global climate changes and mass extinctions. One interesting aspect of many LIPs is their spatial proximity to cratons, begging the question of a potential control of thick lithosphere on their emplacement. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and the thick lithospheric mantle of the Precambrian cratons that formed the central portion of Pangea and are currently located on the continents surrounding the Central Atlantic Ocean. CAMP outcrops are frequently located over the margins of the thick cratonic keels, as imaged by recent tomographic studies, suggesting a role of lithosphere architecture in controlling magma genesis and emplacement. Here we focus on CAMP dykes and sills from the Hank, Hodh, and Kaarta basins in North-Western Africa (NW-Africa, Mali and Mauritania) emplaced at the edge of the Reguibat and Leo-Man Shields. The investigated intrusive rocks show compositions similar to most CAMP magmas, in particular those of the Tiourjdal geochemical group, limited to NW-Africa, and of the Prevalent group, occurring all over the CAMP. Geochemical modelling of CAMP basalts requires a Depleted MORB Mantle (DMM) source enriched by recycled continental crust (1-4%) and melting beneath a lithosphere of ca. 80 km in thickness. On the contrary, melting under a significantly thicker lithosphere (>110 km) does not produce magmas with compositions similar to those of CAMP basalts. This suggests that CAMP magmatism was likely favoured by decompression-induced partial melting of the upwelling asthenospheric mantle along the steep lithospheric boundaries of stable cratons. The architecture of the pre-existing lithosphere (i.e., the presence of stable thick cratonic keels juxtaposed to relatively thinner lithosphere) appears to have been a critical factor for localizing mantle upwelling and partial melting during extensive magmatic events such as in the CAMP.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"117480","language":"en","automatic_tags":["CentralAtlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP)","cratonic lithosphere","Large Igneous Province (LIP)","magma genesis"]},{"key":"R9JHP9WU","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Etemadi","lastName":"Hana"},{"firstName":"Smoak","lastName":" Joseph M."},{"firstName":"Sanders","lastName":" Christian J."}],"title":"Forest migration and carbon sources to Iranian mangrove soils","publication_title":"Journal of Arid Environments","issn":"0140-1963","doi":"10.1016/j.jaridenv.2018.06.005","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140196318303501","abstract_note":"Mangrove forests rank as one of the world's most productive biomes and their soils are highly efficient in accumulating organic carbon (OC).

The organic carbon content, TOC:TN ratios and δ13C signatures indicate that marine algae and microalgae are a greater source of organic material than the terrestrial inputs at three out of the four study sites in this work.

Atmospheric moisture was increased indirectly by increasing the sea surface temperature (SST) in the simulation initial conditions, and by letting the regional atmospheric model adjust the atmospheric fields to the SST perturbation. The SST was increased in two ways: 1) using spatially constant increments and 2) using a climate change perturbation field obtained from a climate projection. For each SST scenario, the PD over the target area was maximized by using a physically based storm transposition method. Although the mean PD, that was obtained by averaging over all shifting increments, increased with SST, the maximum PD was obtained for the case of no SST increase. It was found that, in the case of no SST increase, the worst-case tropical cyclone track was significantly different than in the SST increase scenarios. In particular, in this case, the storm spent a longer time in the simulation inner domain, thus spawning a larger PD over the target area.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"916-926","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Dynamicaldownscaling","Hurricane Ivan","Intense precipitation","Moisture maximization","Storm transposition"]},{"key":"CJI2J8WZ","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Lugo","lastName":"Ariel E."},{"firstName":"Abelleira Martínez","lastName":" Oscar J."},{"firstName":"Medina","lastName":" Ernesto"},{"firstName":"Aymard","lastName":" Gerardo"},{"firstName":"Heartsill Scalley","lastName":" Tamara"}],"title":"Chapter Two - Novelty in the tropical forests of the 21st century","publication_title":"Advances in Ecological Research","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065250420300088","abstract_note":"We review literature relevant to assessing the future of tropical forests and supplement the review with new data from the lowlands of Venezuela. Compared to today, future tropical forests will have a higher level of novelty, defined as the degree of dissimilarity of a system relative to a historical baseline. Processes of succession and evolution generate novelty in forests and have done so for millennia. Under increasing human activity and climate change, the rate of generation of novelty has increased and the resulting forests are termed novel forests to distinguish them from historical forests. Historical forests are less exposed to anthropogenic disturbances and operate at slower levels of novelty generation. Acclimation, adaptation, changes in species composition and dominance, and changes in the proportions of species in communities are the responses of the biota to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, novelty contributes to the persistence of tropical forests in spite of increasing levels of human activity. Novel forests are similar to historical forests in terms of structure but they are younger, they have a faster turnover of mass and chemical elements, and different species composition. Historical species assemblages cannot cope with the altered environments that result from chronic anthropogenic disturbances. The dominant species in novel forests tend to be, and function as, pioneer species. High levels of species dominance in novel forests influence the proportions of chemical elements, which when coupled to species traits and attributes, help explain how novel forests cope with the conditions that result from anthropogenic activities. Novelty is more common in the tropics than in other latitudinal regions, and within the tropics, it is more common in islands where human activity is more intense than in continents. Novel tropical forests in islands have greater representation and dominance of introduced species than novel forests in continents, where native species with wide geographic distributions dominate. Regardless of geography, novel tropical forests share similar attributes and functioning. The adaptability of novel forests to extreme conditions created by human activity signals a future for tropical forests that is different from predictions of constant degradation, homogenization, and loss of biodiversity. Instead, a process of recombination of species (all taxa) into new species assemblages maintains structure, function, physiognomy, species richness, and ecological services. This remixing initially involves loss of large organisms, certain groups of species, and loss of old-growth attributes of forests. Some of these losses can be reversed through succession, assuming there is sufficient time to restore depleted stores such as soil organic matter. Continued environmental change will stimulate continued remixing of species, loss of vulnerable species, gains of less vulnerable ones, and more dissimilarity with historical forests. Novel forests are an answer to the changes induced by climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances, and as such require conservation measures, because as they mature, novel forests usually diversify and help restore lost biodiversity. We also review strategies to conserve biodiversity and optimize ecological services using novel forest succession.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"53-116","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Neotropics","Caribbean","Anthropocene","Historical forests","Los Llanos","Novel forests","Pioneer species","Plant traits","Puerto Rico","Secondary forests","Species dominance","Succession","Venezuela"]},{"key":"2TFL34VJ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Le"},{"firstName":"Lu","lastName":" Fei"},{"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":" Xiaoping"},{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":" Xiaoke"},{"firstName":"Duan","lastName":" Xiaonan"},{"firstName":"Sun","lastName":" Binfeng"}],"title":"Progress in the studies on the greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs","publication_title":"Acta Ecologica Sinica","issn":"1872-2032","doi":"10.1016/j.chnaes.2013.05.011","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872203214000249","abstract_note":"The green credentials of hydroelectricity in terms of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions have been tarnished with the finding of the researches on GHG emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs in the last two decades.

CH4 contributes strongly to climate change because it has a global warming potential (GWP) 24times higher than carbon dioxide (CO2) on a per molecule basis over a 100-year time horizon.

Insect-transmitted NTDs include, but are not limited to, malaria, dengue and lymphatic filariasis. Control measures for these disease, are often ignored because of the associated cost. Many of the developing country members are thus retained in a financially crippling cycle, balancing the cost of prophylactic measures with that of controlling an outbreak. The purpose of the paper is to bring awareness to NTDs transmitted by insects of importance to humans, and to assess factors affecting such control, in the English-speaking Caribbean. Method Comprehensive literature review on reports pertaining to NTDs transmitted by insects in the Caribbean and Latin America was conducted. Data search was carried out on PubMed, and WHO and PAHO websites. Results and conclusion Potential risk factors for NTDs transmitted by arthropods in the English-speaking Caribbean are summarised. The mosquito appears to be the main insect-vector of human importance within the region of concern. Arthropod-vectors of diseases of veterinary importance are also relevant because they affect the livelihood of farmers, in highly agriculture based economies. Other NTDs may also be in circulation gauged by the presence of antibodies in Caribbean individuals. However, routine diagnostic tests for specific diseases are expensive and tests may not be conducted when diseases are not prevalent in the population. It appears that only a few English-speaking Caribbean countries have examined secondary reservoirs of pathogens or assessed the effectivity of their insect control methods. As such, disease risk assessment appears incomplete. Although continuous control is financially demanding, an integrated and multisectoral approach might help to deflect the cost. Such interventions are now being promoted by health agencies within the region and various countries are creating and exploring the use of novel tools to be incorporated in their insect-vector control programmes.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"100316","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mosquito","Caribbean","Infectious diseases","Insect","Arthropod-borne disease","Neglected tropical diseases","Tropical medicine"]},{"key":"HB55KH8F","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2009","author":[{"firstName":"Kounda-Kiki","lastName":"C."},{"firstName":"Celini","lastName":" L."},{"firstName":"Ponge","lastName":" J.

Improved awareness is warranted as the number of cases has increased as a result of increased travel to endemic countries, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the larger number of military and contract workers deployed overseas. Objective We sought to present a systematic review of evidence from a gamut of research trials on the treatment efficacy of different regimens and aggregate this knowledge for use as a guide for clinical practice decisions. Methods We performed a comprehensive search of print and electronic sources to identify the accumulated research information on New World CL. Results Topical treatment of New World CL lesions is generally not recommended. Findings support the systemic administration of pentavalent antimonials as first-line treatment. Exception to this is infection with L guyanensis in French Guiana where systemic pentamidine is suggested as first-line treatment. Limitations The reliability of the findings of this review of research evidence is dependent on the individual quality and potential bias in its component principal trials. There was a conscious attempt to only include evidence derived from randomized controlled studies, with adequate randomization, adequate patient numbers, and complete follow-up information. However, because of the relatively small number of such studies on New World CL, evidence from nonrandomized studies and case series studies was also considered. Conclusions The pentavalent antimony compounds remain the first-line treatment choice for the treatment of New World CL. Concerns with cost, availability, poor compliance, and systemic toxicity, however, may compel clinicians to opt for alternative treatment modalities. Some advances in the development of an antileishmanial vaccine have been made but none is yet available for clinic use. The increase, over recent years, in the incidence of CL warrants an enhanced effort to increase awareness of the disease, assure timely diagnosis, and implement effective management and treatment strategies.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"309-322","language":"en","automatic_tags":["cutaneous","diagnosis","leishmaniasis","New World","treatment"]},{"key":"DICGLN8G","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"D'Apolito","lastName":"Carlos"},{"firstName":"Absy","lastName":" Maria Lúcia"},{"firstName":"Latrubesse","lastName":" Edgardo M."}],"title":"The movement of pre-adapted cool taxa in north-central Amazonia during the last glacial","publication_title":"Quaternary Science Reviews","issn":"0277-3791","doi":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.05.017","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379117301786","abstract_note":"The effects of climate change on the lowland vegetation of Amazonia during the last glacial cycle are partially known for the middle and late Pleniglacial intervals (late MIS 3, 59–24 ka and MIS 2, 24–11 ka), but are still unclear for older stages of the last glacial and during the last interglacial. It is known that a more seasonal dry-wet climate caused marginal forest retraction and together with cooling rearranged forest composition to some extent. This is observed in pollen records across Amazonia depicting presence of taxa at glacial times in localities where they do not live presently. The understanding of taxa migration is hindered by the lack of continuous interglacial-glacial lowland records. We present new data from a known locality in NW Amazonia (Six Lakes Hill), showing a vegetation record that probably started during MIS 5 (130–71 ka) and lasted until the onset of the Holocene. The vegetation record unravels a novel pattern in tree taxa migration: (1) from the beginning of this cycle Podocarpus and Myrsine are recorded and (2) only later do Hedyosmum and Alnus appear. The latter group is largely restricted to montane biomes or more distant locations outside Amazonia, whereas the first is found in lowlands close to the study site on sandy soils. These findings imply that Podocarpus and Myrsine responded to environmental changes equally and this reflects their concomitant niche use in NW Amazonia. Temperature drop is not discarded as a trigger of internal forest composition change, but its effects are clearer later in the Pleniglacial rather than the Early Glacial. Therefore early climatic/environmental changes had a first order effect on vegetation that invoke alternative explanations. We claim last glacial climate-induced modifications on forest composition favoured the expansion of geomorphologic-soil related processes that initiated forest rearrangement.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"1-12","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazonia","Vegetation structure","Glacial","Plant migration","Pollen"]},{"key":"WK9QUXHG","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Sardans","lastName":"Jordi"},{"firstName":"Urbina","lastName":" Ifigenia"},{"firstName":"Grau","lastName":" Oriol"},{"firstName":"Asensio","lastName":" Dolores"},{"firstName":"Ogaya","lastName":" Romà"},{"firstName":"Peñuelas","lastName":" Josep"}],"title":"Long-term drought decreases ecosystem C and nutrient storage in a Mediterranean holm oak forest","publication_title":"Environmental and Experimental Botany","issn":"0098-8472","doi":"10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.104135","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098847220301611","abstract_note":"Aridity has increased in recent decades in the Mediterranean Basin and is projected to continue to increase in the coming decades.

It was observed that there was a temporal variation of the methane flux in the sediments exposed in the three scenarios studied: drought, flooding and full (0.43, −0.31 and −0.01 mg CH4 m-2 h-1, respectively). The CH4 flux by area in the scenario with the highest exposed sediment area was 0.195 ton CH4 d-1.

However, the temporal variability of these fluxes indicated the need for future monitoring initiatives that seek to understand how climate change affects the biochemical processes within the exposed sediments of drawdown zones.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"463-470","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Methane","Drawdown zone","Extreme drought","Reservoir","Sediment"]},{"key":"X3UU2RIN","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Chambault","lastName":"Philippine"},{"firstName":"Roquet","lastName":" Fabien"},{"firstName":"Benhamou","lastName":" Simon"},{"firstName":"Baudena","lastName":" Alberto"},{"firstName":"Pauthenet","lastName":" Etienne"},{"firstName":"de Thoisy","lastName":" Benoît"},{"firstName":"Bonola","lastName":" Marc"},{"firstName":"Dos Reis","lastName":" Virginie"},{"firstName":"Crasson","lastName":" Rodrigue"},{"firstName":"Brucker","lastName":" Mathieu"},{"firstName":"Le Maho","lastName":" Yvon"},{"firstName":"Chevallier","lastName":" Damien"}],"title":"The Gulf Stream frontal system: A key oceanographic feature in the habitat selection of the leatherback turtle?","publication_title":"Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers","issn":"0967-0637","doi":"10.1016/j.dsr.2017.03.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063716303016","abstract_note":"Although some associations between the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea and the Gulf Stream current have been previously suggested, no study has to date demonstrated strong affinities between leatherback movements and this particular frontal system using thorough oceanographic data in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The importance of the Gulf Stream frontal system in the selection of high residence time (HRT) areas by the North Atlantic leatherback turtle is assessed here for the first time using state-of-the-art ocean reanalysis products. Ten adult females from the Eastern French Guianese rookery were satellite tracked during post-nesting migration to relate (1) their horizontal movements to physical gradients (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Height (SSH) and filaments) and biological variables (micronekton and chlorophyll a), and (2) their diving behaviour to vertical structures within the water column (mixed layer, thermocline, halocline and nutricline). All the turtles migrated northward towards the Gulf Stream north wall. Although their HRT areas were geographically remote (spread between 80–30°W and 28–45 °N), all the turtles targeted similar habitats in terms of physical structures, i.e. strong gradients of SST, SSH and a deep mixed layer. This close association with the Gulf Stream frontal system highlights the first substantial synchronization ever observed in this species, as the HRTs were observed in close match with the autumn phytoplankton bloom. Turtles remained within the enriched mixed layer at depths of 38.5±7.9m when diving in HRT areas, likely to have an easier access to their prey and maximize therefore the energy gain. These depths were shallow in comparison to those attained within the thermocline (82.4±5.6m) while crossing the nutrient-poor subtropical gyre, probably to reach cooler temperatures and save energy during the transit. In a context of climate change, anticipating the evolution of such frontal structure under the influence of global warming is crucial to ensure the conservation of this vulnerable species.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"35-47","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Divingbehaviour","North Atlantic","Post-nesting migration","Satellite tracking"]},{"key":"UUXVX6X6","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Bonnet","lastName":"Pierre L."},{"firstName":"Sonor","lastName":" Fabrice"},{"firstName":"Miossec","lastName":" Charline"},{"firstName":"Nguyen","lastName":" Duc"},{"firstName":"Fernandes","lastName":" Elisabeth"},{"firstName":"Yébakima","lastName":" André"},{"firstName":"Desbois-Nogard","lastName":" Nicole"}],"title":"Malaria in Martinique, French West Indies","publication_title":"Infectious Diseases Now","issn":"2666-9919","doi":"10.1016/j.idnow.2021.09.002","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991921005078","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"55-57","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Malaria","Martinique"]},{"key":"D4BQU7FA","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2010","author":[{"firstName":"Mazzei","lastName":"Lucas"},{"firstName":"Sist","lastName":" Plinio"},{"firstName":"Ruschel","lastName":" Ademir"},{"firstName":"Putz","lastName":" Francis E."},{"firstName":"Marco","lastName":" Phidias"},{"firstName":"Pena","lastName":" Wagner"},{"firstName":"Ferreira","lastName":" Josué Evandro Ribeiro"}],"title":"Above-ground biomass dynamics after reduced-impact logging in the Eastern Amazon","publication_title":"Forest Ecology and Management","issn":"0378-1127","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2009.10.031","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112709007737","abstract_note":"Changes in above-ground biomass (AGB) of 17 1ha logged plots of terra firme rain forest in the eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas) were monitored for four years (2004–2008) after reduced-impact logging. Over the same time period, we also monitored two 0.5ha plots in adjacent unlogged forest. While AGB in the control plots changed little over the observation period (increased on average 1.4Mgha−1), logging resulted in immediate reductions in ABG that averaged 94.5Mgha−1 (±42.0), which represented 23% of the 410Mgha−1 (±64.9) present just prior to harvesting. Felled trees (dbh>55cm) accounted for 73% (±15) of these immediate losses but only 18.9Mgha−1 (±8.1) of biomass was removed in the extracted logs. During the first year after logging, the annual AGB balance (annual AGB gain by recruitment and growth−annual AGB loss by mortality) remained negative (−31.1Mgha−1year−1; ±16.7), mainly due to continued high mortality rates of damaged trees. During the following three years (2005–2008), average net AGB accumulation in the logged plots was 2.6Mgha−1year−1 (±4.6). Post-logging biomass recovery was mostly through growth (4.3±1.5Mgha−1year−1 for 2004–2005 and 6.8±0.9Mgha−1year−1 for 2005–2008), particularly of large trees. In contrast, tree recruitment contributed little to the observed increases in AGB (1.1±0.6Mgha−1year−1 for 2004–2005 and 3.1±1.3Mgha−1year−1 for 2005–2008). Plots with the lowest residual basal area after logging generally continued to lose more large trees (dbh ≥70cm), and consequently showed the greatest AGB losses and the slowest overall AGB gains. If 100% AGB recovery is desired and the 30-year minimum cutting cycle defined by Brazilian law is adhered to, current logging intensities (6treesha−1) need to be reduced by 40–50%. Such a reduction in logging intensity will reduce financial incomes to loggers, but might be compensated for by the payment of environmental services through the proposed REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"367-373","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazonianrainforest management","Biomass dynamics","Improved forest management","REDD","Tropical silviculture"]},{"key":"NLLB6Q2J","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2010","author":[{"firstName":"Bicknell","lastName":"Jake"},{"firstName":"Peres","lastName":" Carlos A."}],"title":"Vertebrate population responses to reduced-impact logging in a neotropical forest","publication_title":"Forest Ecology and Management","issn":"0378-1127","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2010.02.027","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811271000143X","abstract_note":"Vertebrate population densities were quantified in lowland central Guyana using line-transect censuses at three forest sites subjected to reduced-impact logging (RIL), and three adjacent unlogged sites. We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9m3ha−1, equivalent to only 1.1treesha−1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"2267-2275","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Guyana","Guiana","Reduced-impact logging","Forestry","Iwokrama","Timber"]},{"key":"98UXCURQ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"1999","author":[{"firstName":"Pelling","lastName":"Mark"}],"title":"The political ecology of flood hazard in urban Guyana","publication_title":"Geoforum","issn":"0016-7185","doi":"10.1016/S0016-7185(99)00015-9","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718599000159","abstract_note":"Some 90% of the Guyanese population are at risk from contemporary flood hazard and the potential impacts of climate change and sea-level rise.

Here the Diversity Storage Hypothesis posits that immense biological diversity resides within skewed species-abundance distributions of tropical trees, and further predicts that many species will adjust to increases of 1.5–3.0 °C anticipated from climate change by 2100. Common and widespread tropical trees (>100,000,000 individuals) may shift ranges but are unlikely to face extinction. Many rare species (e.g. <1000 individuals) have a more precarious future. The latter may be declining species bound for extinction, incipient species adjusting to environmental changes, or relics of past warmer and more seasonal climates that will be resurrected if processes of seed dispersal allow them to persist and spread. In fragmented agricultural landscapes, preserved or planted corridors, buffers and stepping-stone habitat patches around and between forest remnants are more vital than efforts to preserve or create contemporary forest compositions, dominance relations, and species-abundance distributions. An implication of Diversity Storage is that it is more important to facilitate migration into and out of changing landscapes to allow inherent diversity to adjust and coexist with agricultural economies than to resist change.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"349-358","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Conservation","Tropical forest","Biodiversity","Seed dispersal","Rarity","Restoration ecology"]},{"key":"UFQ77SX2","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2013","author":[{"firstName":"Fernandes","lastName":"Alexandre M."},{"firstName":"Gonzalez","lastName":" Javier"},{"firstName":"Wink","lastName":" Michael"},{"firstName":"Aleixo","lastName":" Alexandre"}],"title":"Multilocus phylogeography of the Wedge-billed Woodcreeper Glyphorynchus spirurus (Aves, Furnariidae) in lowland Amazonia: Widespread cryptic diversity and paraphyly reveal a complex diversification pattern","publication_title":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","issn":"1055-7903","doi":"10.1016/j.ympev.2012.09.033","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790312004022","abstract_note":"Amazonian rivers function as important barriers to dispersal of Amazonian birds. Studying population genetics of lineages separated by rivers may help us to uncover the dynamics of biological diversification in the Amazon. We reconstructed the phylogeography of the Wedge-billed Woodcreeper, Glyphorynchus spirurus (Furnariidae) in the Amazon basin. Sampling included 134 individuals from 63 sites distributed in eight Amazonian areas of endemism separated by major Amazonian rivers. Nucleotide sequences were generated for five genes: two mtDNA genes (1047bp for cyt b and 1002bp for ND2) and three nuclear genes (647bp from the sex-linked gene ACO, 319bp from the intron of G3PDH, and 619bp from intron 2 of MYO). In addition, 37 individuals were randomly selected from the Rondônia and Inambari areas of endemism for genomic fingerprinting, using five ISSR primers. Our results reveal allopatric and well-supported lineages within G. spirurus with high levels of genetic differentiation (p-distances 0.9–6.3%) across opposite banks of major Amazonian rivers. The multilocus phylogenetic reconstructions obtained reveal several incongruences with current subspecies taxonomy. Within currently recognized subspecies, we found high levels of both paraphyly and genetic differentiation, indicating deep divergences and strong isolation consistent with species-level differences. ISSR fingerprinting supports the existence of genetically differentiated populations on opposite sides of the Madeira River. Molecular dating suggests an initial vicariation event isolating populations from the Guiana center of endemism during the Late Miocene/Early Pliocene, while more recent events subdivided Brazilian Shield populations during the Lower Pleistocene.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"270-282","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazonia","Cryptic species","Historical biogeography","ISSR genomic fingerprinting","Multilocus phylogeography"]},{"key":"X67D39LY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"deOliveira-Ferreira","lastName":" Nara"},{"firstName":"Manhães","lastName":" Bárbara M.

Two weeks later, the mud arrived to the marine environment, triggering changes in franciscana dolphin habitat, Pontoporia blainvillei, from Franciscana Management Area Ia. This is an isolated population of the most endangered cetacean species in the South Atlantic Ocean. Organohalogen compounds (OHCs) may pose a threat to this endangered population because of their endocrine disrupting properties. Hence, this study sought to determine if there were differences in the bioaccumulation profile of OHC (PCBs, DDTs, Mirex, HCB, HCHs, PBDEs, PBEB, HBBZ and MeO-BDEs) in franciscana dolphins before and after dam collapse and to build a temporal trend. Blubber of 33 stranded individuals was collected in Espírito Santo state for organohalogen assessment between 2003 and 2019. Differences were found between franciscana dolphins collected prior to and after the disaster. Additionally, significant temporal trends for organochlorine pesticides and natural and anthropogenic organobromine were detected. The increase in pesticide concentrations after 2015 is suggestive of their reavailability in the environment. The decline in organobromine over time could be due to their debromination in the marine environment and alterations in the composition of their natural producers. PCBs remained stable during the period of the study. Our findings show an increase in endocrine disruptor concentrations, which is of great concern for this endangered population.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"119370","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Endocrinedisruptors","Franciscana management area Ia","Fundão dam collapse","Persistent Organic pollutants","Pontoporiidae"]},{"key":"WCEAVQSX","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Debels","lastName":"Patrick"},{"firstName":"Fanning","lastName":" Lucia"},{"firstName":"Mahon","lastName":" Robin"},{"firstName":"McConney","lastName":" Patrick"},{"firstName":"Walker","lastName":" Laverne"},{"firstName":"Bahri","lastName":" Tarub"},{"firstName":"Haughton","lastName":" Milton"},{"firstName":"McDonald","lastName":" Karen"},{"firstName":"Perez","lastName":" Manuel"},{"firstName":"Singh-Renton","lastName":" Susan"},{"firstName":"Toro","lastName":" Cesar"},{"firstName":"Van Anrooy","lastName":" Raymon"},{"firstName":"Khouri","lastName":" Alessandra Vanzella"},{"firstName":"Whalley","lastName":" Peter"}],"title":"The CLME+ Strategic Action Programme: An ecosystems approach for assessing and managing the Caribbean Sea and North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystems","publication_title":"Environmental Development","issn":"2211-4645","doi":"10.1016/j.envdev.2016.10.004","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211464516302305","abstract_note":"For more than a decade, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), national governments, several United Nations agencies and regional organisations have been supporting the development, and now also the implementation of the Strategic Action Programme (SAP) for the Sustainable Management of the Shared Living Marine Resources of the Caribbean and North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystems (resp.

These Large Marine Ecosystems or LMEs provide critical ecosystem services supporting human well-being in this region, particularly for the fisheries and tourism sectors. Unsustainable fisheries, habitat degradation and pollution are three key threats to CLME+ marine ecosystems, and their effects are being exacerbated by climate change. Root causes of these threats include: weak governance; limited human and financial resources; inadequate knowledge; inadequate public awareness and participation; inadequate consideration of the value of ecosystem goods and services; population and cultural pressures; and trade and external dependency. The CLME+ SAP addresses these weaknesses through six distinct strategies aimed at strengthening regional cooperation, institutional reform, and capacity building at the regional, national and local levels over the short (0–5 years) and medium (6–10 years) term. The SAP has been endorsed at the political level by 24 countries and it will be implemented through a partnership approach: “the Global Alliance for the coordinated implementation of the CLME+ SAP”

While better understanding of these forests is critical for our collective future, until quite recently efforts to measure and monitor them have been largely disconnected. Networking is essential to discover the answers to questions that transcend borders and the horizons of funding agencies. Here we show how a global community is responding to the challenges of tropical ecosystem research with diverse teams measuring forests tree-by-tree in thousands of long-term plots. We review the major scientific discoveries of this work and show how this process is changing tropical forest science. Our core approach involves linking long-term grassroots initiatives with standardized protocols and data management to generate robust scaled-up results. By connecting tropical researchers and elevating their status, our Social Research Network model recognises the key role of the data originator in scientific discovery. Conceived in 1999 with RAINFOR (South America), our permanent plot networks have been adapted to Africa (AfriTRON) and Southeast Asia (T-FORCES) and widely emulated worldwide. Now these multiple initiatives are integrated via ForestPlots.net cyber-infrastructure, linking colleagues from 54 countries across 24 plot networks. Collectively these are transforming understanding of tropical forests and their biospheric role. Together we have discovered how, where and why forest carbon and biodiversity are responding to climate change, and how they feedback on it. This long-term pan-tropical collaboration has revealed a large long-term carbon sink and its trends, as well as making clear which drivers are most important, which forest processes are affected, where they are changing, what the lags are, and the likely future responses of tropical forests as the climate continues to change. By leveraging a remarkably old technology, plot networks are sparking a very modern revolution in tropical forest science. In the future, humanity can benefit greatly by nurturing the grassroots communities now collectively capable of generating unique, long-term understanding of Earth's most precious forests. Resumen Los bosques tropicales son los ecosistemas más diversos y productivos del mundo y entender su funcionamiento es crítico para nuestro futuro colectivo. Sin embargo, hasta hace muy poco, los esfuerzos para medirlos y monitorearlos han estado muy desconectados. El trabajo en redes es esencial para descubrir las respuestas a preguntas que trascienden las fronteras y los plazos de las agencias de financiamiento. Aquí mostramos cómo una comunidad global está respondiendo a los desafíos de la investigación en ecosistemas tropicales a través de diversos equipos realizando mediciones árbol por árbol en miles de parcelas permanentes de largo plazo. Revisamos los descubrimientos más importantes de este trabajo y discutimos cómo este proceso está cambiando la ciencia relacionada a los bosques tropicales. El enfoque central de nuestro esfuerzo implica la conexión de iniciativas locales de largo plazo con protocolos estandarizados y manejo de datos para producir resultados que se puedan trasladar a múltiples escalas. Conectando investigadores tropicales, elevando su posición y estatus, nuestro modelo de Red Social de Investigación reconoce el rol fundamental que tienen, para el descubrimiento científico, quienes generan o producen los datos. Concebida en 1999 con RAINFOR (Suramérica), nuestras redes de parcelas permanentes han sido adaptadas en África (AfriTRON) y el sureste asiático (T-FORCES) y ampliamente replicadas en el mundo. Actualmente todas estas iniciativas están integradas a través de la ciber-infraestructura de ForestPlots.net, conectando colegas de 54 países en 24 redes diferentes de parcelas. Colectivamente, estas redes están transformando nuestro conocimiento sobre los bosques tropicales y el rol de éstos en la biósfera. Juntos hemos descubierto cómo, dónde y porqué el carbono y la biodiversidad de los bosques tropicales está respondiendo al cambio climático y cómo se retroalimentan. Esta colaboración pan-tropical de largo plazo ha expuesto un gran sumidero de carbono y sus tendencias, mostrando claramente cuáles son los factores más importantes, qué procesos se ven afectados, dónde ocurren los cambios, los tiempos de reacción y las probables respuestas futuras mientras el clima continúa cambiando. Apalancando lo que realmente es una tecnología antigua, las redes de parcelas están generando una verdadera y moderna revolución en la ciencia tropical. En el futuro, la humanidad puede beneficiarse enormemente si se nutren y cultivan comunidades de investigadores de base, actualmente con la capacidad de generar información única y de largo plazo para entender los que probablemente son los bosques más preciados de la tierra. Resumo Florestas tropicais são os ecossistemas mais diversos e produtivos da Terra. Embora uma boa compreensão destas florestas seja crucial para o nosso futuro coletivo, até muito recentemente os esforços de medições e monitoramento tem sido amplamente desconexos. É essencial formarmos redes para obtermos respostas que transcendam as fronteiras e horizontes das agências financiadoras. Neste estudo nós mostramos como uma comunidade global está respondendo aos desafios da pesquisa de ecossistemas tropicais, com equipes diversas medindo florestas, árvore por árvore, em milhares de parcelas monitoradas a longo prazo. Nós revisamos as maiores descobertas científicas deste esforço global, e mostramos também como este processo vem mudando a ciência de florestas tropicais. Nossa abordagem principal envolve unir iniciativas de base a protocolos padronizados e gerenciamento de dados a fim de gerar resultados robustos em grandes escalas. Ao conectar pesquisadores tropicais e elevar seus status, nosso modelo de Rede de Pesquisa Social reconhece o papel chave do produtor dos dados na descoberta científica. Concebida em 1999 com o RAINFOR (América do Sul), nossa rede de parcelas permanentes foi adaptada para África (AfriTRON) e Sudeste Asiático (T-FORCES), e tem sido extensamente reproduzida em todo o mundo. Agora estas múltiplas iniciativas estão integradas através da infraestrutura cibernética do ForestPlots.net, conectando colegas de 54 países e 24 redes de parcelas. Estas iniciativas estão transformando coletivamente o entendimento das florestas tropicais e seus papéis na biosfera. Juntos nós descobrimos como, onde e por que o carbono e a biodiversidade da floresta estão respondendo às mudanças climáticas, e seus efeitos de retroalimentação. Esta duradoura colaboração pantropical revelou um grande sumidouro de carbono persistente e suas tendências, assim como tem evidenciado quais os fatores que influenciam essas tendências, quais processos florestais são mais afetados, onde eles estão mudando, seus atrasos no tempo de resposta, e as prováveis respostas das florestas tropicais conforme o clima continua a mudar. Dessa forma, aproveitando uma notável tecnologia antiga, redes de parcelas acendem as faíscas de uma moderna revolução na ciência das florestas tropicais. No futuro a humanidade pode se beneficiar incentivando estas comunidades locais que agora são coletivamente capazes de gerar conhecimentos únicos e duradouros sobre as florestas mais preciosas da Terra. Résume Les forêts tropicales sont les écosystèmes les plus diversifiés et les plus productifs de la planète. Si une meilleure compréhension de ces forêts est essentielle pour notre avenir collectif, jusqu'à tout récemment, les efforts déployés pour les mesurer et les surveiller ont été largement déconnectés. La mise en réseau est essentielle pour découvrir les réponses à des questions qui dépassent les frontières et les horizons des organismes de financement. Nous montrons ici comment une communauté mondiale relève les défis de la recherche sur les écosystèmes tropicaux avec diverses équipes qui mesurent les forêts arbre après arbre dans de milliers de parcelles permanentes. Nous passons en revue les principales découvertes scientifiques de ces travaux et montrons comment ce processus modifie la science des forêts tropicales. Notre approche principale consiste à relier les initiatives de base à long terme à des protocoles standardisés et une gestion de données afin de générer des résultats solides à grande échelle. En reliant les chercheurs tropicaux et en élevant leur statut, notre modèle de réseau de recherche sociale reconnaît le rôle clé de l'auteur des données dans la découverte scientifique. Conçus en 1999 avec RAINFOR (Amérique du Sud), nos réseaux de parcelles permanentes ont été adaptés à l'Afrique (AfriTRON) et à l'Asie du Sud-Est (T-FORCES) et largement imités dans le monde entier. Ces multiples initiatives sont désormais intégrées via l'infrastructure ForestPlots.net, qui relie des collègues de 54 pays à travers 24 réseaux de parcelles. Ensemble, elles transforment la compréhension des forêts tropicales et de leur rôle biosphérique. Ensemble, nous avons découvert comment, où et pourquoi le carbone forestier et la biodiversité réagissent au changement climatique, et comment ils y réagissent. Cette collaboration pan-tropicale à long terme a révélé un important puits de carbone à long terme et ses tendances, tout en mettant en évidence les facteurs les plus importants, les processus forestiers qui sont affectés, les endroits où ils changent, les décalages et les réactions futures probables des forêts tropicales à mesure que le climat continue de changer. En tirant parti d'une technologie remarquablement ancienne, les réseaux de parcelles déclenchent une révolution très moderne dans la science des forêts tropicales. À l'avenir, l'humanité pourra grandement bénéficier du soutien des communautés de base qui sont maintenant collectivement capables de générer une compréhension unique et à long terme des forêts les plus précieuses de la Terre. Abstrak Hutan tropika adalah di antara ekosistem yang paling produktif dan mempunyai kepelbagaian biodiversiti yang tinggi di seluruh dunia. Walaupun pemahaman mengenai hutan tropika amat penting untuk masa depan kita, usaha-usaha untuk mengkaji dan mengawas hutah-hutan tersebut baru sekarang menjadi lebih diperhubungkan. Perangkaian adalah sangat penting untuk mencari jawapan kepada soalan-soalan yang menjangkaui sempadan dan batasan agensi pendanaan. Di sini kami menunjukkan bagaimana sebuah komuniti global bertindak balas terhadap cabaran penyelidikan ekosistem tropika melalui penglibatan pelbagai kumpulan yang mengukur hutan secara pokok demi pokok dalam beribu-ribu plot jangka panjang. Kami meninjau semula penemuan saintifik utama daripada kerja ini dan menunjukkan bagaimana proses ini sedang mengubah bidang sains hutan tropika. Teras pendekatan kami memberi tumpuan terhadap penghubungan inisiatif akar umbi jangka panjang dengan protokol standar serta pengurusan data untuk mendapatkan hasil skala besar yang kukuh. Dengan menghubungkan penyelidik-penyelidik tropika dan meningkatkan status mereka, model Rangkaian Penyelidikan Sosial kami mengiktiraf kepentingan peranan pengasas data dalam penemuan saintifik. Bermula dengan pengasasan RAINFOR (Amerika Selatan) pada tahun 1999, rangkaian-rangkaian plot kekal kami kemudian disesuaikan untuk Afrika (AfriTRON) dan Asia Tenggara (T-FORCES) dan selanjutnya telah banyak dicontohi di seluruh dunia. Kini, inisiatif-inisiatif tersebut disepadukan melalui infrastruktur siber ForestPlots.net yang menghubungkan rakan sekerja dari 54 negara di 24 buah rangkaian plot. Secara kolektif, rangkaian ini sedang mengubah pemahaman tentang hutan tropika dan peranannya dalam biosfera. Kami telah bekerjasama untuk menemukan bagaimana, di mana dan mengapa karbon serta biodiversiti hutan bertindak balas terhadap perubahan iklim dan juga bagaimana mereka saling bermaklum balas. Kolaborasi pan-tropika jangka panjang ini telah mendedahkan sebuah sinki karbon jangka panjang serta arah alirannya dan juga menjelaskan pemandu-pemandu perubahan yang terpenting, di mana dan bagaimana proses hutan terjejas, masa susul yang ada dan kemungkinan tindakbalas hutan tropika pada perubahan iklim secara berterusan di masa depan. Dengan memanfaatkan pendekatan lama, rangkaian plot sedang menyalakan revolusi yang amat moden dalam sains hutan tropika. Pada masa akan datang, manusia sejagat akan banyak mendapat manfaat jika memupuk komuniti-komuniti akar umbi yang kini berkemampuan secara kolektif menghasilkan pemahaman unik dan jangka panjang mengenai hutan-hutan yang paling berharga di dunia.","date_added":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","date_modified":"2022-05-16 13:19:13","pages":"108849","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Globalchange","Amazonia","Biodiversity","Ecology","Monitoring","Africa","AfriTRON","Carbon sink","Dynamics","Forest plots","Permanent sample plots","RAINFOR","Rainforest","Southeast Asia","Species richness"]},{"key":"IDSNZKXW","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Reimer","lastName":"C."},{"firstName":"Melzer","lastName":" T."},{"firstName":"Wagner","lastName":" W."}],"title":"4.04 - Long-Term Soil Moisture Data Records Derived From a Series of European Scatterometers","publication_title":"Comprehensive Remote Sensing","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095489103549","abstract_note":"The article gives an in-depth overview of historical and recent advancements in the soil moisture retrieval from European C-band scatterometer missions.

Global sea levels are rising due to climate change and this will accelerate through this century: a rise of more than 1m is possible. In some locations these changes may be exacerbated by (1) increases in storminess due to climate change, although this is less certain, and (2) human-induced subsidence due to ground fluid withdrawal from and drainage of susceptible soils, especially in deltas and alluvial plains. Sea-level rise has a range of potential impacts including higher extreme sea levels (and flooding), coastal erosion, and salinization of surface and ground waters. This threatens the loss of large areas of land and associated assets and economic activity, the displacement of millions of people, and significant coastal habitat degradation. However, adaptation can greatly reduce these impacts and promote prosperous and desirable coasts. Adaptation measures can be characterized as (1) protect, (2) accommodate, or (3) retreat approaches. The provision of information measures such as warnings is improving significantly, while novel methods such as ecosystem-based approaches are attracting interest. Adaptation to sea-level rise should be viewed as a process that requires an integrated coastal management philosophy to be consistent with wider coastal activities and other stresses. Hence, in addition to technical skills, adaptation requires an appropriate institutional capacity. The success or failure of measures of adaptation, especially protection, is contested and this influences our view of sea-level rise as a problem. Adaptation can be best analyzed in the context of understanding the coastal system that includes the effects of all drivers, including sea-level rise, their interactions, and feedbacks: these types of analyses are only just beginning. Some proactive adaptation plans are already being formulated, such as around London and in the Netherlands. Coastal cities will be a major focus for adaptation efforts due to their concentrations of people and assets. However, there are important challenges for adaptation in developing countries, most especially in deltaic areas and small islands.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"243-270","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Accommodation","Adaptation","Coasts","Protection","Retreat"]},{"key":"ZWVPASPK","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"deSouza","lastName":" T.

In order to supply this increasing demand while also using environmentally friendly and locally available feedstock, several countries have implemented the use of biofuels, in which biodiesel deserves special attention. While this alternative source of energy may reduce dependence on refining or importing fossil diesel, it also requires well-established policies and logistics for local industries to compete and succeed in producing a satisfactory quantity of biodiesel. This review compares the effectiveness of implemented policies in South American countries, providing a better understanding on cases of success and failure on the road to making biodiesel a regularly found fuel in the local transportation network. This assessment also clearly identifies different stages of development, pointing out that countries from the same region can have totally different outcomes according to political and market aspects. The main factors associated to cases of success, represented by Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, were early implemented regulation policies, the solidity of local soybean industry and response to foreign competition. Finally, Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) is a new and efficient green fuel used in Diesel engines and will likely present additional challenges for this sector, potentially replacing both diesel and biodiesel in the fuel network, and posing a challenge to even the most stable biodiesel industries, along with the potential vehicle electrification.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"111755","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biodiesel","Diesel fuel","Electrification","Energy policy","HVO","South America"]},{"key":"NRDEP9WY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Bernards","lastName":"Nick"}],"title":"‘Latent’ surplus populations and colonial histories of drought, groundnuts, and finance in Senegal","publication_title":"Geoforum","issn":"0016-7185","doi":"10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.10.007","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718519302969","abstract_note":"Amidst growing concern about the displacement of rural populations exposed to climate change, new financial instruments are increasingly being presented as key tools for the management of climate risks.

However, the promotion of new financial instruments in response to crises of agrarian production has a much longer history in Africa and elsewhere. This article draws on Marx’s concept of ‘latent’ surplus populations to trace out and explain parallels between IBAI and colonial interventions in Senegal’s groundnut basin. Approaching the question in this way, the article highlights the long-run historical co-production and interdependence of the Senegalese state and a political ecology of groundnut production in which relations of indebtedness and the exposure to variable rainfall of a fragile relative surplus population has often been crucial to the mobilization of cheap labour for groundnut production. IBAI is thus positioned as part of a recurrent trajectory of emergency financial interventions aimed at smoothing out the contradictions implicit in this socio-ecological configuration.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"441-450","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climate","Colonialism","Index insurance","Marx","Senegal","Surplus populations"]},{"key":"7QSA7SX7","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Crossley","lastName":"Michael"},{"firstName":"Sprague","lastName":" Terra"}],"title":"Education for sustainable development: Implications for small island developing states (SIDS)","publication_title":"International Journal of Educational Development","issn":"0738-0593","doi":"10.1016/j.ijedudev.2013.03.002","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059313000369","abstract_note":"Climate change and global recession have especially dramatic implications for small island developing states (SIDS).

They are under threat by direct anthropogenic impacts like deforestation and the indirect anthropogenic impacts of climate change. A synthesis of the factors that determine the net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) at the site scale across different forests in the tropical rainforest biome has not been undertaken to date. Here, we study NEE and its components, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (RE), across thirteen natural and managed forests within the tropical rainforest biome with 63 total site-years of eddy covariance data. Our results reveal that the five ecosystems with the largest annual gross carbon uptake by photosynthesis (i.e. GEP > 3000 g C m−2 y-1) have the lowest net carbon uptake – or even carbon losses – versus other study ecosystems because RE is of a similar magnitude. Sites that provided subcanopy CO2 storage observations had higher average magnitudes of GEP and RE and lower average magnitudes of NEE, highlighting the importance of measurement methodology for understanding carbon dynamics in ecosystems with characteristically tall and dense vegetation. A path analysis revealed that vapor pressure deficit (VPD) played a greater role than soil moisture or air temperature in constraining GEP under light saturated conditions across most study sites, but to differing degrees from -0.31 to -0.87 μmol CO2 m−2 s-1 hPa-1. Climate projections from 13 general circulation models (CMIP5) under the representative concentration pathway that generates 8.5 W m−2 of radiative forcing suggest that many current tropical rainforest sites on the lower end of the current temperature range are likely to reach a climate space similar to present-day warmer sites by the year 2050, warmer sites will reach a climate not currently experienced, and all forests are likely to experience higher VPD. Results demonstrate the need to quantify if and how mature tropical trees acclimate to heat and water stress, and to further develop flux-partitioning and gap-filling algorithms for defensible estimates of carbon exchange in tropical rainforests.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"292-307","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatevariability","Ecosystem respiration","Eddy covariance","Gross primary productivity","Net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange","Tropical rainforest"]},{"key":"WHV6AUKC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2005","author":[{"firstName":"Brooks","lastName":"Nick"},{"firstName":"Neil Adger","lastName":" W."},{"firstName":"Mick Kelly","lastName":" P."}],"title":"The determinants of vulnerability and adaptive capacity at the national level and the implications for adaptation","publication_title":"Global Environmental Change","issn":"0959-3780","doi":"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2004.12.006","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378004000913","abstract_note":"We present a set of indicators of vulnerability and capacity to adapt to climate variability, and by extension climate change, derived using a novel empirical analysis of data aggregated at the national level on a decadal timescale.

The first two families comprise the superfamily Pseudothephusoidea, which is principally associated with high-altitude environments, while the Trichodactylidae is found mainly in lowlying areas. The pseudothelphusids, or mountain crabs, are the main subject of this study. This family comprises 49 genera and 293 species and is the most threatened group because the freshwater environments in the Neotropics are increasingly threatened. The 2008 IUCN global conservation assessment found 15.5% of the superfamily Pseudothelphusoidea to be threatened with extinction and projected that in the worst-case scenario (if the Data Deficient species when eventually assessed are all in a threatened category), then the number of threatened species would be alarmingly high (72%). The reassessments presented here include more than 40 new species of pseudothelphusids that have been described since the first assessment, together with improved data on ecology, distribution, and threats. More than one-fifth (21.2%) of Neotropical pseudothelphusoids were found to be threatened with extinction, notably in South America where the threats are all associated with the rapid growth of the human population in montane environments. The principal threats to pseudothelphusids include deforestation, water pollution, and dam construction. Additionally, this study shows the need for more studies on freshwater crab ecology, population trends, and threats that can in turn be used to formulate urgently needed conservation action plans.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Deforestation","Conservation","Dam construction","Extinction","Mountain crabs","Neotropical region","Pseudothelphusids","Pseudothelphusoidea","Reassessment","Red list","Threats","Water pollution"]},{"key":"F9R637CJ","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Primavera","lastName":"Jurgenne H."},{"firstName":"Friess","lastName":" Daniel A."},{"firstName":"Van Lavieren","lastName":" Hanneke"},{"firstName":"Lee","lastName":" Shing Yip"}],"title":"Chapter 1 - The Mangrove Ecosystem","publication_title":"World Seas: an Environmental Evaluation (Second Edition)","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128050521000012","abstract_note":"Climate change and the 2014 tsunami have raised the profile and importance of mangroves.

Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric equations to convert forest inventory data into AGB estimates. In this study, we tested whether central African forests are really different from other tropical forests with respect to biomass allometry, and further examined the regional variation in tropical tree allometry across the Congo basin forests. Following the same standardized protocol, trees were destructively sampled for AGB in six sites representative of terra firme forests. We fitted regional and local allometric models, including tree diameter, wood specific gravity, tree height, and crown radius in the AGB predictors. We also evaluated the AGB predictions at the tree level across the six sites of our new models and of existing allometric models, including the pantropical equations developed by Chave et al. (2014, 2005) and the local equations developed by Ngomanda et al. (2014) in Gabon. With a total of 845 tropical trees belonging to 55 African species and covering a large range of diameters (up to 200 cm), the original data presented here can be considered as the largest ever destructive sampling for a tropical region. Regional allometric models were established and including tree height and crown radius had a small but significant effect on AGB predictions. In contrast to our expectations, tree height and crown radius did not explain much between-site variation. Examining the performance of general models (pantropical or regional) versus local models (site-specific), we found little advantage of using local equations. Earlier pantropical equations developed for moist forests were found to provide reasonable predictions of tree AGB in most sites, though the wettest sites, i.e., evergreen forests in Equatorial Guinea and, to a lesser extent in Gabon, tended to show a wet forest allometry. For the Congo basin forests, except in Equatorial Guinea where local models might be preferred, we recommend using our regional models, and otherwise the most recent pantropical models, that were validated here. These results constitute a critical step for the estimation and monitoring of biomass/carbon stocks contained in the second largest contiguous block of tropical forests worldwide, and the successful implementation of climate change mitigation strategies, such as REDD+.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"228-240","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biomass","Allometry","Carbon","Congo basin","Crown radius","Total tree height","Tree diameter","Tropical trees","Wood specific gravity"]},{"key":"47DF9ILN","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Langston","lastName":"Amy K."},{"firstName":"Kaplan","lastName":" David A."}],"title":"Modelling the effects of climate, predation, and dispersal on the poleward range expansion of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans)","publication_title":"Ecological Modelling","issn":"0304-3800","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109245","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438002030315X","abstract_note":"Globally, species ranges are shifting in response to climate change. For black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), fewer severe freeze events in a warming climate facilitate poleward range expansion into temperate coastal salt marshes, however propagules that disperse into marshes encounter biotic interactions (e.g., predation) that affect their survival and subsequent forest development. To better understand the relative roles of climate, predation, and propagule dispersal in shaping A. germinans range expansion, we developed a stage-based population model that tested forest stand establishment and survival under differing scenarios of freeze regime, predation pressure, and propagule dispersal. Predation parameters were developed from a field experiment that tested propagule density-predation intensity relationships for purple marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum), which showed proportional propagule consumption decreased with increased propagule density. Model outcomes demonstrated all measures of mangrove stand development and regeneration decreased with increased freeze and predation intensities, modulated by propagule dispersal density and frequency. Regenerating stands were more likely to recover from freezes under a reduced freeze regime compared to a historical freeze regime, but moderate and high predation intensities hindered stand development and recovery across freeze regimes. Maintaining a regenerating stand generally required recurring dispersal events. While several studies have investigated the individual effects of freezes, predation pressure, and dispersal on mangrove ranges, our model is the first effort of which we are aware that quantifies the combined effects of all three controls. The model can thus serve as a tool for understanding patterns of A. germinans range expansion in the Big Bend and other regions under future warming.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"109245","language":"en","automatic_tags":["BigBend","Bottom-up","Coastal forest","Ecological controls","Population model","Top-down"]},{"key":"K8PT4LR6","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Vegas-Vilarrúbia","lastName":"T."},{"firstName":"Hernández","lastName":" E."},{"firstName":"Rull","lastName":" Valentí"},{"firstName":"Rull Vegas","lastName":" Elisa"}],"title":"The Orinoco megadelta as a conservation target in the face of the ongoing and future sea level rise","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.01.056","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715000716","abstract_note":"Currently, risk assessments related to rising sea levels and the adoption of defensive or adaptive measures to counter these sea level increases are underway for densely populated deltas where economic losses might be important, especially in the developed world.

In this study, we explore the potential effects of erosion, inundation and salinisation on one of the world's comparatively underpopulated megadeltas, the Orinoco Delta. With a 1m sea level rise expected to occur by 2100, several models predict a moderate erosion of the delta's shorelines, migration or loss of mangroves, general inundation of the delta with an accompanying submersion of wetlands, and an increase in the distance to which sea water intrudes into streams, resulting in harm to the freshwater biota and resources. The Warao people are the indigenous inhabitants of the Orinoco Delta and currently are subject to various socioeconomic stressors. Changes due to sea level rise will occur extremely rapidly and cause abrupt shifts in the Warao's traditional environments and resources, resulting in migrations and abandonment of their ancestral territories. However, evidence indicates that deltaic aggradation/accretion processes at the Orinoco delta due to allochthonous sediment input and vegetation growth could be elevating the surface of the land, keeping pace with the local sea level rise. Other underpopulated and large deltas of the world also may risk immeasurable biodiversity and cultural losses and should not be forgotten as important conservation targets.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"129-142","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Globalwarming","Climate change","Biodiversity","Indigenous cultures","Coastal flooding","Hydrochemistry","Large deltas","Neotropic","Wetland"]},{"key":"FFLT8M9P","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Pincebourde","lastName":"S."},{"firstName":"van Baaren","lastName":" J."},{"firstName":"Rasmann","lastName":" S."},{"firstName":"Rasmont","lastName":" P."},{"firstName":"Rodet","lastName":" G."},{"firstName":"Martinet","lastName":" B."},{"firstName":"Calatayud","lastName":" P. -A."}],"title":"Chapter Nine - Plant–Insect Interactions in a Changing World","publication_title":"Advances in Botanical Research","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065229616300957","abstract_note":"Global change is resetting the spatial and ecological equilibrium of complex co-evolutionary relationships between plants and their insect herbivores.

We distinguish between the direct effects of global changes on each partner from the indirect impacts on insects via the responses of plants. The indirect effects include a change in the nutritional quality of the plant tissues for herbivore insects, as well as a change in the microclimatic conditions at the leaf surface. Pollinators are involved in a close symbiotic relationship with their favourite plants, and any depression caused by climate stress can lead to pollination deficit. Pollinators are, indeed, quite sensitive to global changes. Furthermore, although species are connected by trophic links, all species respond differently to global changes. We highlight that more research is needed to elucidate the plant-mediated indirect effects of climate change on insects. Then, other human activities, such as land transformations and release of pollutants, are likely to modulate these links between climate and plant–insect relationships. We argue that predicting the net effect of global change on plant–insect relationships requires a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that modulate the interaction strength between the plants and the insects, rather than on focusing on each partner individually.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"289-332","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Globalchange","Land use","Food web","Herbivory","Microclimate","Plant defences","Plant–insect interactions","Pollination","Pollution","Temperature"]},{"key":"NAVK3YAH","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2012","author":[{"firstName":"Fouquet","lastName":"Antoine"},{"firstName":"Loebmann","lastName":" Daniel"},{"firstName":"Castroviejo-Fisher","lastName":" Santiago"},{"firstName":"Padial","lastName":" José M."},{"firstName":"Orrico","lastName":" Victor G.

Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that the actual number of species in South American tropical forests is largely underestimated, but also that many lineages are millions of years old. The genera Phyzelaphryne (1 sp.) and Adelophryne (6 spp.), which compose the subfamily Phyzelaphryninae, include poorly documented, secretive, and minute frogs with an unusual distribution pattern that encompasses the biotic disjunction between Amazonia and the Atlantic forest. We generated >5.8kb sequence data from six markers for all seven nominal species of the subfamily as well as for newly discovered populations in order to (1) test the monophyly of Phyzelaphryninae, Adelophryne and Phyzelaphryne, (2) estimate species diversity within the subfamily, and (3) investigate their historical biogeography and diversification. Phylogenetic reconstruction confirmed the monophyly of each group and revealed deep subdivisions within Adelophryne and Phyzelaphryne, with three major clades in Adelophryne located in northern Amazonia, northern Atlantic forest and southern Atlantic forest. Our results suggest that the actual number of species in Phyzelaphryninae is, at least, twice the currently recognized species diversity, with almost every geographically isolated population representing an anciently divergent candidate species. Such results highlight the challenges for conservation, especially in the northern Atlantic forest where it is still degraded at a fast pace. Molecular dating revealed that Phyzelaphryninae originated in Amazonia and dispersed during early Miocene to the Atlantic forest. The two Atlantic forest clades of Adelophryne started to diversify some 7Ma minimum, while the northern Amazonian Adelophryne diversified much earlier, some 13Ma minimum. This striking biogeographic pattern coincides with major events that have shaped the face of the South American continent, as we know it today.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"547-561","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazonia","Cryptic species","Atlantic forest","Neotropical diversity"]},{"key":"2FV4AX4M","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2006","author":[{"firstName":"Peterson","lastName":"Larry C."},{"firstName":"Haug","lastName":" Gerald H."}],"title":"Variability in the mean latitude of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone as recorded by riverine input of sediments to the Cariaco Basin (Venezuela)","publication_title":"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","issn":"0031-0182","doi":"10.1016/j.palaeo.2005.10.021","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018205006115","abstract_note":"Changes in the strength and position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) are an important component of climate variability in the tropical Atlantic. The Cariaco Basin, located on the northern margin of Venezuela, is sensitive to tropical Atlantic climate change and its sediments provide a record of past ITCZ behavior. Today, the Cariaco Basin experiences two distinct seasons that reflect the annual migration of the Atlantic ITCZ. Between January and March, when the ITCZ lies south of the equator, northeasterly trade winds sit directly over Cariaco Basin and strong coastal upwelling and dry conditions dominate. Beginning in June–July, as the ITCZ moves north, local rainfall reaches a maximum and the upwelling diminishes or disappears. Here we summarize new and previously published data on the river-derived terrigenous fraction of Cariaco Basin sediments, as well as comparisons to other paleoclimate records, which together suggest a coherent climatologic response in the tropical Atlantic triggered by a pattern of ITCZ migration that mimics the seasonal cycle. During periods of cooler North Atlantic SSTs, on time-scales ranging from the Little Ice Age to the Younger Dryas to the cold stadials of the last glacial, decreased detrital delivery to Cariaco Basin from local rivers suggests a southward shift in the mean latitudinal position of the ITCZ. During warm interstadials and periods of Holocene and deglacial warmth, northward shifts in ITCZ position and its belt of convective rainfall are inferred from increased detrital delivery to the basin. Whether the rapid shifts in ITCZ position and precipitation recorded by Cariaco Basin sediments and other regional records reflect a response to forcing originating in the high latitude Atlantic or to forcing potentially sourced in the tropics is a key question yet to be fully answered.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"97-113","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Abruptclimate change","Cariaco Basin","Intertropical Convergence Zone","Paleoclimatology","Past rainfall variability"]},{"key":"75DCMFL3","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":""}],"title":"Subject Index","publication_title":"Biodiversity of Pantepui","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128155912000318","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"445-452","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"J82A7ISY","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Diaz","lastName":"Vitali"},{"firstName":"Corzo","lastName":" Gerald"},{"firstName":"Pérez","lastName":" José R."}],"title":"3 - Large-Scale Exploratory Analysis of the Spatiotemporal Distribution of Climate Projections: Applying the STRIVIng Toolbox","publication_title":"Spatiotemporal Analysis of Extreme Hydrological Events","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128116890000033","abstract_note":"Extreme hydrological events (EHEs), such as droughts and floods, vary spatially and temporally in nature. The increase in the number of events in the last few decades has motivated the research of the spatiotemporal variability of the future extreme precipitation and temperature.

In addition, for proper planning and decision-making process to address EHEs, understanding such climate changes requires more information. In this chapter we present a summarized assessment of the spatiotemporal variations of climate projections.

The methodology and toolbox presented here allow regions to be identified where the changes are expected to be more severe on precipitation and temperature, as well as months in which those changes are likely to occur.

In this chapter we ask whether Pantepui as a biogeographical unit has remained invariable through the Quaternary in spite of the glacial–interglacial cyclicity typical of this geological period. For this purpose, we split the Pantepui concept into three main components, namely the orographic, the climatic, and the biotic. The existing paleoecological evidence suggests that these three Pantepui components have been recurrently assembled and disassembled during interglacial and glacial phases, respectively. This is called here the Pantepui oscillator. Glacial climates have been dominant and are considered the norm during the Quaternary, whereas interglacials are viewed as abrupt warmings maintained by external energy inputs derived from positive feedbacks exacerbating solar forcing. As a consequence, interglacial Pantepui assembly may be viewed as an abrupt and comparatively short-lived unstable biogeographical state that is disrupted during glaciations, leading to a more stable state characterized by the disassembly of the orographic, climatic, and biotic Pantepui components. It follows that, rather than a present-day static biogeographical unit, Pantepui is a dynamic concept where biotic variations are linked to climatic peculiarities of each interglacial period, as well as species’ idiosyncratic responses, including eventual speciation and extinction events. The oscillator concept is used to forecast the potential state of Pantepui as a biogeographical unit in the near future under the global warming predicted for the end of this century.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"55-67","language":"en","automatic_tags":["biogeography","climate change","glacial","interglacial","Pantepui","Pantepui oscillator","Quaternary"]},{"key":"X8HNXMM3","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Charlier","lastName":"Dorothée"},{"firstName":"Legendre","lastName":" Bérangère"},{"firstName":"Ricci","lastName":" Olivia"}],"title":"Measuring fuel poverty in tropical territories: A latent class model","publication_title":"World Development","issn":"0305-750X","doi":"10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105278","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20304058","abstract_note":"There are well established strategies for measuring fuel poverty in developed countries based on heating factors correlated with household income (expenditure, heating restriction or cold houses), but they do not translate well to tropical regions where climatic conditions and socioeconomic contexts entail different energy use. Fuel poverty in tropical regions has never been defined. We propose a new framework for the identification of fuel-poor households based on Sen's capability approach. We employ latent class model (LCM) methodology to accurately assess fuel poverty in tropical areas using observable objective characteristics of decent, safe and healthy dwellings. This approach enables us to categorize households as fuel-poor or fuel-sufficient. It is also possible to extend the model further by considering the multi-dimensional phenomenon of fuel poverty. We find that the most deprived represent approximately 12% of the population, while 32% of the population is expected to belong to the fuel-sufficient class. An intermediate class encompassing 56% of the population represents vulnerable households that could easily be affected by an exogenous shock. Energy deprivation is much more complex and multidimensional than a binary phenomenon, implying that fuel poverty can be measured with different degrees of exposure. With this research, we enable policy makers to identify a target group of households that should be a top priority in fighting fuel poverty in tropical regions.","date_added":"2022-05-16

fluxes in the global C cycle and is a key factor in understanding the global C balance associated with climate change, but the factors controlling its spatial variability have not been well explored. This study aimed to clarify the causes of spatial variation in soil respiration rate on volcanic ash soil. We established a standing-tree (ST) plot and a clear-cutting (CC) plot in December 2012 at a 35-year-old Cryptomeria japonica plantation in Tokyo, Japan. CC plot was logged in March 2013, and new organic matter supply was halted after clear-cutting. From January 2013 to August 2019, soil respiration rates were measured periodically at 21 and 19 measuring points in ST and CC plots, respectively. The measuring points were randomly distributed with varying distances in ST plot (0.24 ha) and CC plot (0.23 ha). In August 2019, the carbon content of the litter (Ao) layer, total carbon content of soil, carbon content of the low-density fraction (LF-C; < 1.6 g cm−3) of soil, fine root biomass, and bulk density of soil for 0–5, 5–15, and 15–30 cm mineral soil layers were measured at all measuring points. The spatial pattern of the variation in soil respiration rates remained stable in the ST plot throughout the 7-year study period. Results of the multiple regression analysis in the ST plot showed that the model with only the LF-C as an explanatory variable had the highest capability for predicting the respiration rate at a soil temperature of 20 °C (R20); the addition of other factors as explanatory variables did not increase the predictive capability. The organic carbon content in soil did not correlate with R20. The R20 in the CC plot significantly decreased six years after clear-cutting compared with the first year after clear-cutting, with values of 3.03 and 1.86 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1, respectively. This decrease tended to be greater in the measuring points where R20 was high in 2013. The LF-C stock for 0–30 cm soil layer in CC plot in the 7th year after clear-cutting was 0.33 kgC m−2 which was much lower than 1.60 kgC m−2 in ST plot. These results further support the conclusion that LF-C was the main factor responsible for the spatial variation in soil respiration rate in the ST plot, and suggest that LF-C is more suitable than SOC as an explanatory variable for the spatial variation in soil respiration rate in volcanic ash soil.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"e00529","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Soilorganic carbon","Clear-cutting","Fine root biomass","Heterotrophic respiration","Litter","Low-density fraction"]},{"key":"996PQZ84","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Félix","lastName":"Fernando"},{"firstName":"Fernández","lastName":" Jaime E."},{"firstName":"Paladines","lastName":" Anaid"},{"firstName":"Centeno","lastName":" Ruby"},{"firstName":"Romero","lastName":" Juan"},{"firstName":"Burneo","lastName":" Santiago F."}],"title":"Habitat use of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in the Gulf of Guayaquil, Ecuador: Management needs for a threatened population","publication_title":"Ocean & Coastal Management","issn":"0964-5691","doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106174","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569122001491","abstract_note":"The habitat use by two neighboring coastal bottlenose dolphin communities (Posorja and El Morro) was evaluated in the western inner estuary of the Gulf of Guayaquil, Ecuador (3°S, 80°55′W).

Multinomial logistic regression with four environmental parameters (distance to shore, depth, hour of day and tide) were used as predictor variables of behavior. A significant relationship between the tidal cycle and behavioral states was found with feeding occurring more frequently during the low tide, socializing and transit during high tide, and resting during mid-tide. Count models were used with environmental and behavioral variables to explore their relationship with dolphins' group size. Differences with respect to dolphin counts were associated with tide height and socialization. Depth is relevant for predicting dolphin counts mainly during high tide. We recommend that environmental authorities consider the dolphins' preference to carry out their activities within small home ranges, identify overlapping human activities and take steps to reduce potential conflicts, such as prohibiting all types of gillnets in areas of high concentration of dolphins. Likewise, regular assessments are required to detect future changes in both dolphins' habitat and human uses over time.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"106174","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Conservation","Bottlenose dolphin","Ecuador","Environmental variables","Habitat use","Management"]},{"key":"HKQ8YVPV","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Sethi","lastName":"Mahendra"},{"firstName":"Puppim de Oliveira","lastName":" Jose"}],"title":"From global ‘North–South’ to local ‘Urban–Rural’: A shifting paradigm in climate governance?","publication_title":"Urban Climate","issn":"2212-0955","doi":"10.1016/j.uclim.2015.09.009","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095515300201","abstract_note":"As the world takes an unprecedented rural–urban population tilt, the 21st century poses a challenge in further tinkering the internationally evident disparities in access and allocation of carbon.

The study argues that existing dualities in the international climate change governance, evident in the so called global ‘North–South’ economic divide, has a stronger component of ‘Urban–Rural’ spatial disparity in the making, which is likely to further precipitate into a much local but complex dynamic, particularly relevant to the developing world, that face the double challenge of rapid urbanization and environmental sustainability.

Mountain clade radiations are generally associated with changes in environment, climate, and the increase in heterogeneity therein during mountain building. However, examining the causal relationship between mountain building and diversification is a complex challenge, because isolating the effects of surface uplift from other abiotic (climate) or biotic variables is not straightforward. In this study, we investigate the relative contributions of abiotic climate-driven (temperature) and geology-driven (elevation) drivers on evolutionary rates of ancient groups of organisms in the South American Andes. We present regional curves of Andean elevation based on a recent compilation of paleo-elevational data back to the Late Cretaceous, and analyse the diversification history of six Andean frog and lizard families that originated equally far back in time. For two clades (Aromobatidae and Leptodactylidae), we find that they diversified most rapidly during the early phase of mountain building (Late Cretaceous - Paleogene), when the first high-elevation habitats emerged in South America. The diversification of one clade (Centrolenidae) is correlated with Cenozoic temperature variations, with higher speciation rates during warm periods. The last three clades (Dendrobatidae, Hemiphractidae and Liolaemidae) are best explained by environment-independent diversification, although for Liolaemidae, an almost equally strong positive correlation was found between speciation and Andean elevation since the late Eocene. Our findings imply that throughout the long-lived history of surface uplift in the Andes, mountain building drove the diversification of different clades at different times, while not directly affecting other clades. Our study illustrates the importance of paleogeographic reconstructions that capture the complexity and heterogeneity of mountain building in our understanding of the effects that a changing environment plays in shaping biodiversity patterns observed today.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"103704","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Neotropics","Biodiversity","Andes","Diversification","Phylogenetics","Uplift"]},{"key":"A676CEH8","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":""}],"title":"Authors","publication_title":"Encyclopedia of Geology (Second Edition)","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081029084099409","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"1-13","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"UH4WVGZU","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Yadav","lastName":"Sadhana"},{"firstName":"Padalia","lastName":" Hitendra"},{"firstName":"Sinha","lastName":" Sanjiv K."},{"firstName":"Srinet","lastName":" Ritika"},{"firstName":"Chauhan","lastName":" Prakash"}],"title":"Above-ground biomass estimation of Indian tropical forests using X band Pol-InSAR and Random Forest","publication_title":"Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","issn":"2352-9385","doi":"10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100462","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352938520306376","abstract_note":"Accurately assessing the biomass of tropical forests is a challenge for the scientific community.

However, information about their distribution and sources in this area is scarce, despite increasing deforestation and oil exploitation. Therefore, individual PAHs were analysed in the sediments of the Oyapock estuary, which is located in the Amazon coastal zone. This study provides information about the spatial and short-term temporal distributions of PAHs and discusses the major sources of PAHs to better understand the anthropogenic processes occurring in adjacent areas. The concentrations of all sixteen priority PAHs defined by the US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency, ∑16PAHs) ranged from 10.9 to 138.8 ng g−1 with a mean and standard deviation = 37.9 ± 20.5 and indicated that this estuary is not contaminated, while the mean levels were similar to those found in other Amazon regions and pristine areas along the coast of Brazil. No significant differences were found in the sedimentary PAHs levels between the wet and dry sampling campaigns, despite the different climatic conditions. Diagnostic ratios, positive matrix factorization (PMF) and cluster analysis have shown that the majority of the investigated PAHs were derived from combustion processes (at least 55.1%, as estimated by the PMF model). Localized source inputs from oil and its by-products concomitantly with natural/biogenic sources appear to be secondary sources. The PAH contribution from biomass and wood combustion was approximately 13.6% and was relatively lower than other regions of the Amazon that are undergoing massive biomass burning. As the first study of PAHs in this region, this study provides vital information on the healthy state of the estuary and can serve as a baseline for assessing the impacts of acute oil disasters or the chronic input of PAHs as a result of human settlements.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"115958","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Rainforest","Combustion","Oyapock estuary","Perylene","PMF model","Sediments"]},{"key":"IYRX7GR9","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Quegan","lastName":"Shaun"},{"firstName":"Le Toan","lastName":" Thuy"},{"firstName":"Chave","lastName":" Jerome"},{"firstName":"Dall","lastName":" Jorgen"},{"firstName":"Exbrayat","lastName":" Jean-François"},{"firstName":"Minh","lastName":" Dinh Ho Tong"},{"firstName":"Lomas","lastName":" Mark"},{"firstName":"D'Alessandro","lastName":" Mauro Mariotti"},{"firstName":"Paillou","lastName":" Philippe"},{"firstName":"Papathanassiou","lastName":" Kostas"},{"firstName":"Rocca","lastName":" Fabio"},{"firstName":"Saatchi","lastName":" Sassan"},{"firstName":"Scipal","lastName":" Klaus"},{"firstName":"Shugart","lastName":" Hank"},{"firstName":"Smallman","lastName":" T.

To meet this objective it will carry, for the first time in space, a fully polarimetric P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Three main products will be provided: global maps of both AGB and forest height, with a spatial resolution of 200 m, and maps of severe forest disturbance at 50 m resolution (where “global” is to be understood as subject to Space Object tracking radar restrictions). After launch in 2022, there will be a 3-month commissioning phase, followed by a 14-month phase during which there will be global coverage by SAR tomography. In the succeeding interferometric phase, global polarimetric interferometry Pol-InSAR coverage will be achieved every 7 months up to the end of the 5-year mission. Both Pol-InSAR and TomoSAR will be used to eliminate scattering from the ground (both direct and double bounce backscatter) in forests. In dense tropical forests AGB can then be estimated from the remaining volume scattering using non-linear inversion of a backscattering model. Airborne campaigns in the tropics also indicate that AGB is highly correlated with the backscatter from around 30 m above the ground, as measured by tomography. In contrast, double bounce scattering appears to carry important information about the AGB of boreal forests, so ground cancellation may not be appropriate and the best approach for such forests remains to be finalized. Several methods to exploit these new data in carbon cycle calculations have already been demonstrated. In addition, major mutual gains will be made by combining BIOMASS data with data from other missions that will measure forest biomass, structure, height and change, including the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar deployed on the International Space Station after its launch in December 2018, and the NASA-ISRO NISAR L- and S-band SAR, due for launch in 2022. More generally, space-based measurements of biomass are a core component of a carbon cycle observation and modelling strategy developed by the Group on Earth Observations. Secondary objectives of the mission include imaging of sub-surface geological structures in arid environments, generation of a true Digital Terrain Model without biases caused by forest cover, and measurement of glacier and icesheet velocities. In addition, the operations needed for ionospheric correction of the data will allow very sensitive estimates of ionospheric Total Electron Content and its changes along the dawn-dusk orbit of the mission.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"44-60","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biomass","Carbon cycle","Pol-InSAR","Forest disturbance","Forest height","Icesheet and glacier motion","Ionospheric effects","P-band SAR","Polarimetry","Sub-surface imaging","Tomographic SAR","Unbiased DTM"]},{"key":"7KLXRXBY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Ciullo","lastName":"Alessio"},{"firstName":"Martius","lastName":" Olivia"},{"firstName":"Strobl","lastName":" Eric"},{"firstName":"Bresch","lastName":" David N."}],"title":"A framework for building climate storylines based on downward counterfactuals: The case of the European Union Solidarity fund","publication_title":"Climate Risk Management","issn":"2212-0963","doi":"10.1016/j.crm.2021.100349","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096321000784","abstract_note":"Recent research introduced the concept of climate storylines as an alternative approach to estimate climate impact and better deal with uncertainties. A climate storyline is an event-based approach which aims at building “physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways”. As such, climate storylines may profit from downward counterfactual thinking, which aims at analyzing how past events could have been worse. Notwithstanding the various applications of downward counterfactual thinking in the natural risk management literature, no study relates this with the climate storyline approach. The main goal of this paper is thus to introduce a framework that supports the development of climate storylines from downward counterfactuals. The framework is event-oriented, it focuses on impact, and it is designed to be applied in a participatory fashion. As a proof-of-concept application, we study the impact of tropical cyclones on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) without conducting a participatory analysis. Tropical cyclones represent a serious threat for the European outermost regions, and their impact to the EUSF capital availability has never been studied. We find that payouts due to tropical cyclones can hamper a recovery of the fund if large payouts concurrently occur in mainland Europe. To avoid this also considering future changes, an increase in capitalization up to 90 % percent may be required.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"100349","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatestorylines","Downward counterfactuals","European Union Solidarity Fund"]},{"key":"W6HVV8GA","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Santana","lastName":"Herick Soares de"},{"firstName":"Dei Tos","lastName":" Claudenice"},{"firstName":"Minte-Vera","lastName":" Carolina Viviana"}],"title":"A review on the age and growth studies of freshwater fish in South America","publication_title":"Fisheries Research","issn":"0165-7836","doi":"10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105410","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783619302656","abstract_note":"The small quantity of basic studies like age and growth estimates implies a lack of stock assessments and difficulties to make decisions related to fisheries management and biodiversity conservation.

A total of 199 articles covering 259 species were found. This work demonstrates the main gaps in the age and growth studies of freshwater fish from South America. Although there are well-studied basins such as Parana and some parts of the Amazon, most of the ecoregions remain without information or basic studies, and show the need for efforts to improve this situation to better understand the population dynamics of the species. Considering the L∞-K relationship, no evident latitudinal patterns were found, not even for species of the same order. Still, despite the wide use that the growth parameters have in the most diverse models and population studies, our analyses show that the data take a long time to be published, making more applied management and conservation studies unfeasible or, at least, harder. Finally, growth parameter data can contribute to minimize the lack of stock assessments, providing important information for use in management and biodiversity conservation.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"105410","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Bonystructures","Increments","Length frequencies","Longevity"]},{"key":"KPQKTY93","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Rull","lastName":"Valentí"},{"firstName":"Vegas-Vilarrúbia","lastName":" Teresa"},{"firstName":"Huber","lastName":" Otto"},{"firstName":"Señaris","lastName":" Celsa"}],"title":"Introduction","publication_title":"Biodiversity of Pantepui","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128155912000227","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"xv-xviii","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"CT2CRNHI","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Ahrends","lastName":"Antje"},{"firstName":"Hollingsworth","lastName":" Peter M."},{"firstName":"Ziegler","lastName":" Alan D."},{"firstName":"Fox","lastName":" Jefferson M."},{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":" Huafang"},{"firstName":"Su","lastName":" Yufang"},{"firstName":"Xu","lastName":" Jianchu"}],"title":"Current trends of rubber plantation expansion may threaten biodiversity and livelihoods","publication_title":"Global Environmental Change","issn":"0959-3780","doi":"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.06.002","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378015000801","abstract_note":"The first decade of the new millennium saw a boom in rubber prices. This led to rapid and widespread land conversion to monoculture rubber plantations in continental SE Asia, where natural rubber production has increased >50% since 2000. Here, we analyze the subsequent spread of rubber between 2005 and 2010 in combination with environmental data and reports on rubber plantation performance. We show that rubber has been planted into increasingly sub-optimal environments. Currently, 72% of plantation area is in environmentally marginal zones where reduced yields are likely. An estimated 57% of the area is susceptible to insufficient water availability, erosion, frost, or wind damage, all of which may make long-term rubber production unsustainable. In 2013 typhoons destroyed plantations worth US$ >250 million in Vietnam alone, and future climate change is likely to lead to a net exacerbation of environmental marginality for both current and predicted future rubber plantation area. New rubber plantations are also frequently placed on lands that are important for biodiversity conservation and ecological functions. For example, between 2005 and 2010 >2500km2 of natural tree cover and 610km2 of protected areas were converted to plantations. Overall, expansion into marginal areas creates potential for loss-loss scenarios: clearing of high-biodiversity value land for economically unsustainable plantations that are poorly adapted to local conditions and alter landscape functions (e.g. hydrology, erosion) – ultimately compromising livelihoods, particularly when rubber prices fall.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"48-58","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Deforestation","Biodiversity","Cash crops","Rubber","South East Asia"]},{"key":"3VXUQM5Y","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Gianguzza","lastName":"Paola"}],"title":"Chapter 24 - Arbacia","publication_title":"Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012819570300024X","abstract_note":"Arbacia is unique among shallow echinoid genus, not in line with the general rule that sea urchins should be either entirely tropical or entirely temperate, with limited overlap in the subtropics.

Over the past century, Arbacia has been the subject of intense investigations into the cell biology, toxicology, biochemistry, and embryology. Recently, renewed interest in this genus arose from its phylogeny, ecology, and its resilience to ocean warming and acidification. According to several studies, impacts of ocean acidification on Arbacia, growth from the juvenile to mature adult life-stage transition, seems to be mitigated by warming. Functional studies have shown that some Arbacia species play an important role in the ecology of rocky reefs. Manipulative experiments have shown a leading role of Arbacia species in maintaining the coralline barren habitat. All species of Arbacia are omnivorous, with a strong tendency to carnivory. They are able to scrape fleshy algae, sea grasses, encrusting algae, barnacle shells, and hard calcareous tubes of polychaetes from the substrata, thanks to their large Aristotle's lantern, indicative of a durophagic habit. Arbacia is a gonochoric genus with a very early maturity.

Here we aim to study the response of the tropical ocean-atmosphere system to D-O variability by using a sediment core from the southern Caribbean Sea, located under the direct influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). During D-O cycles, abrupt shifts in the deposition of fine-grained terrigenous material sourced from the Orinoco and Amazon rivers are recognized. These sedimentary changes were associated with fluctuations in both the ITCZ location and the AMOC strength through their respective influence on the hydroclimate of northern South America and strength of ocean currents delivering fluvial material to the study site. Stable oxygen isotope data further suggest increase in the upper ocean temperatures in the southeastern Caribbean Sea during stadial events. As these warming trends correlate with Antarctic temperatures, they seem to contain imprints of the bipolar seesaw and AMOC variability, demonstrating that our core location was influenced by processes prevalent in both hemispheres.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"107159","language":"en","automatic_tags":["SouthAmerica","Amazon River","Climate teleconnections","Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles","ITCZ","Orinoco River"]},{"key":"K8E6VSU5","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"James S."},{"firstName":"Bernt","lastName":" Maxwell J."},{"firstName":"Fronk","lastName":" Aaron H."},{"firstName":"Fontenelle","lastName":" Joao P."},{"firstName":"Kuznar","lastName":" Shannon L."},{"firstName":"Lovejoy","lastName":" Nathan R."}],"title":"Late Neogene megariver captures and the Great Amazonian Biotic Interchange","publication_title":"Global and Planetary Change","issn":"0921-8181","doi":"10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.103554","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818121001399","abstract_note":"Recently published time-calibrated molecular phylogenies have brought to light a large-scale biotic interchange between the Western and Eastern Amazon basins, associated with the late Neogene (c. 10–4.5 Ma) uplift of the Northern Andes and formation of the modern transcontinental Amazon river. This important macroevolutionary event was previously overlooked due to poor understanding of alpha taxonomy and geographic distributions, lack of species-dense phylogenetic analyses, and insufficient methods for estimating biogeographic range evolution and lineage divergence times. Rapid improvements in all these areas have now provided the community with a corpus of historical biogeographic studies using species-dense and time-calibrated molecular phylogenies of plant and animal taxa distributed across Greater Amazonia. In this study we present historical biogeographic analyses of two clades of freshwater fishes (potamotrygonid stingrays and apteronotid electric fishes), and synthesize these results with those of 18 other published studies of Amazonian taxa, including riverine and upland (terra firme) clades of plants (n = 5), insects (n = 2), and representatives of all five vertebrate classes; i.e. fishes (n = 4) amphibians (n = 3), non-avian reptiles (n = 2), birds (n = 2), and mammals (n = 2). Our results support the hypothesis that tectonically-driven megariver capture events facilitated a massive biotic interchange between the Western and Eastern Amazon basins, which we name the Great Amazonian Biotic Interchange. These same megacapture events also separated the modern Amazon and Orinoco basins, contributing to the biotic distinctiveness of these megadiverse regions, and thereby elevating the total biodiversity of Greater Amazonia. The results highlight the role of large and rare (Black Swan) landscape evolution events in preserving and promoting biodiversity that had accumulated over tens of millions of years and across the whole of the South American continental platform.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"103554","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Extinction","Biogeography","Dispersal","Landscape evolution","Phylogeny","Speciation"]},{"key":"CPBJ8VXA","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2012","author":[{"firstName":"Kettle","lastName":"Chris J."}],"title":"Seeding ecological restoration of tropical forests: Priority setting under REDD+","publication_title":"Biological Conservation","issn":"0006-3207","doi":"10.1016/j.biocon.2012.03.016","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320712001590","abstract_note":"Tropical deforestation continues to be the major driver of biodiversity loss and a considerable contributor to climate change. Increasing numbers of forest-dependent rural poor rely on degraded forest for their livelihoods. Ecological restoration of tropical forests has the potential to not only contribute to biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation, but also poverty alleviation. REDD+ provides a potentially powerful mechanism for supporting ecological restoration of tropical forests in developing countries. Decisions on when and how forest restoration activities should be implemented will require a detailed understanding of the ecological and socioeconomic context of the particular region. This paper focuses on three seed-related ecological traits of tropical trees which limit the likelihood of natural regeneration of degraded secondary forest or the recovery of abandoned agricultural land. These factors may also provide significant constraints to restoration through direct seeding and planting. A comprehensive review of 367 papers was conducted to evaluate masting phenology, seed storage and seed dispersal distances across important tropical timber tree families. This information is synthesised to identify the implications of these seed-related traits for ecological restoration of tropical forests and its integration into the REDD+ framework. Phenological monitoring, targeted nursery capacity building with a focus on recalcitrant and threatened timber species, the promotion of trees within the agricultural matrix, and conservation of remnant trees, are all important considerations. There is a major gap in our understanding of seed dispersal in heterogeneous landscapes, which must be addressed if we are to develop sustainable strategies for restoration in human dominated landscapes.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"34-41","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Dispersal","Ecological restoration","Masting","Planting","Seed storage","Tropical forests"]},{"key":"KNYPCVRP","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Senger","lastName":"D.

However, their areal extent has declined by over one-third in recent decades. Degraded mangrove forests result in reduced carbon captured and lead to release of stored carbon into the atmosphere by CO2 emission. The aim of this study was to assess changes in carbon dynamics in a gradually degrading mangrove forest on Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean. Remote sensing techniques were applied to estimate the distribution of intact and degraded mangroves. Forest structure, sediment carbon storage, sediment CO2 effluxes and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon in pore and surface waters across intact and degraded parts were assessed. On average intact mangroves showed 31% sediment organic carbon in the upper 30 cm compared to 20% in degraded mangrove areas. A loss of 1.51 MgCO2 ha−1 yr−1 for degraded sites was calculated. Water samples showed a hypersaline environment in the degraded mangrove area averaging 93 which may have caused mangrove dieback. Sediment CO2 efflux within degraded sites was lower than values from other studies where degradation was caused by clearing or cutting, giving new insights into carbon dynamics in slowly degrading mangrove systems. Results of water samples agreed with previous studies where inorganic carbon outwelled from mangroves might enhance ecosystem connectivity by potentially buffering ocean acidification locally. Wetlands will be impacted by a variety of stressors resulting from a changing climate. Results from this study could inform scientists and stakeholders on how combined stresses, such as climate change with salinity intrusion may impact mangrove's blue carbon sink potential and highlight the need of future comparative studies of intact versus degraded mangrove stands.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"141817","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Carbonstocks","Blue carbon","Bonaire","Dissolved organic and inorganic carbon","Greenhouse gases","Remote sensing"]},{"key":"9U54UJFK","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2012","author":[{"firstName":"Barros","lastName":"Regina Mambeli"},{"firstName":"Tiago Filho","lastName":" Geraldo Lúcio"}],"title":"Small hydropower and carbon credits revenue for an SHP project in national isolated and interconnected systems in Brazil","publication_title":"Renewable Energy","issn":"0960-1481","doi":"10.1016/j.renene.2012.04.050","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148112003072","abstract_note":"This study is intended to attain preliminary estimates on the potential for carbon credits for Small hydropower (SHP) projects in the Brazilian overview, which was divided into two phases.

This chapter reviews the existing hypotheses on the origin and evolution of the Pantepui biota in light of the available biogeographical, paleoecological, and molecular phylogenetic evidence. Most (but not all) of the existing theories and hypotheses were developed by earlier zoologists based on biogeographical patterns, and further studies have aimed mainly at testing these ideas. Botanists have rarely mentioned these theories, although they have sometimes used similar proposals to explain the origin of Pantepui flora. Earlier studies on the origin of the Pantepui biota reproduced the classical biogeographical debate between vicariance and dispersalism. Paleoecological study added a more dynamic vision based on Quaternary evidence and showed that elements of both the vicariant and dispersalist hypotheses were needed to understand Pantepui biotic patterns. The advent of molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses allowed the dating of speciation events and the resolution of their spatial components, thus providing critical evidence for both Quaternary and pre-Quaternary diversification trends. The available multidisciplinary evidence shows that the spatiotemporal diversification trends vary among the different taxonomic groups, which makes a single theory on the origin of the Pantepui biota unattainable. As occurs in the Neotropics in general, proper understanding of the origin of Pantepui biotic patterns requires complex thinking and the consideration of multiple drivers, as well as a diversity of ecological and evolutionary processes and mechanisms acting across spatial and temporal scales. A coordinated multidisciplinary effort is needed for a more comprehensive and realistic framework for understanding the origin and evolution of the Pantepui biota.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"69-91","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biodiversity","paleoecology","biogeography","dispersal","diversification","endemism","molecular phylogenetics","vicariance"]},{"key":"GU22KS3M","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2012","author":[{"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Edward J."},{"firstName":"Gratiot","lastName":" Nicolas"}],"title":"Coastal engineering and large-scale mangrove destruction in Guyana, South America: Averting an environmental catastrophe in the making","publication_title":"Ecological Engineering","issn":"0925-8574","doi":"10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.07.005","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092585741200256X","abstract_note":"This short communication highlights potential destabilisation of the muddy coast of Guyana, South America, caused by large-scale mangrove destruction. The stability of the coast of Guyana, which is part of one of the world's most extensive mangrove coasts, depends on large mud banks migrating alongshore from the mouth of the Amazon River and on mangrove colonisation of these banks. Under the pressures of economic development, the coastal zone of Guyana is progressively being transformed into agricultural land and aquaculture estates, protected by coastal dikes. These hard coastal defence structures, constructed in recent years, are less effective in dissipating wave energy than mud banks. They also hinder the various processes involved in the consolidation and subsequent mangrove colonisation of these banks, notably by enclosing mature mangrove forests and preventing propagule transport from these forests to mud banks. If unchecked, the progressive breakdown in the mud-bank and associated mangrove system that has led to progradation of the coastal plain of Guyana over the last 5000 years will result in large-scale coastal erosion that can only be countered by further engineering structures at prohibitive costs. The only coastal defence strategy, sound and viable over the long term, with regards to both environmental conservation and cost, consists in restoring a dynamic mud-bank and mangrove system on this wave-exposed coast.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"268-273","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Guyana","South America","Coastal defence","Ecological engineering","Mangrove destruction","Mangrove restoration","Mud banks"]},{"key":"PAZGC9I2","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Singh","lastName":"Prachi"},{"firstName":"Srivastava","lastName":" Prashant K."},{"firstName":"Mall","lastName":" R.

CPs exhibit highly specialised and often very sensitive ecologies, being generally restricted to nutrient-impoverished habitats where carnivory offers a competitive advantage. As such, they are often the first species to disappear following habitat degradation, land use change, and alteration to natural ecological processes, and are at significant risk from processes such as eutrophication and weed invasion, and even poorly-understood impacts such as airborne nitrogen inputs. Many of the world's 860 species of CPs are found in wetland habitats, which represent some of the most cleared and heavily degraded ecosystems on Earth. Global diversity hotspots for CPs are likewise located in some of the most heavily cleared and disturbed areas of the planet—southwestern Western Australia, Southeast Asia, Mediterranean Europe, central eastern Brazil, and the southeastern United States—placing their conservation at odds with human developmental interests. Many carnivorous plant species exhibit extreme range-restriction and are wholly localised to specific geological formations, microhabitats or elevations, with nowhere to move to in the face of environmental change, such as a warming, drying climate. We provide the first systematic examination of the conservation status and threats to all CPs globally, compiling full or partial assessments of conservation status category for 860 species from 18 genera, and provide ten recommendations towards better conservation and management of this iconic group. A total of 69 species were assessed as Critically Endangered (8% of all species), 47 as Endangered (6%), 104 as Vulnerable (12%), and 23 as Near Threatened (3%). Slightly over 60% of CPs (521 species) were assessed as Least Concern. At least 89 species are known from only a single location based on current knowledge. Data on threatening processes were available for 790 species, with the most common threatening processes including Agriculture and Aquaculture (impacting 170 species), Natural Systems Modifications (168 species), Climate Change and Severe Weather (158 species), Energy Production and Mining (127 species), Human Intrusions and Disturbance (126 species), and Biological Resource Use (98 species). Almost a quarter of all species were impacted upon by three or more threatening processes. The most significant threats placing species at imminent risk of extinction include the continuing clearing of natural habitat for urban and agricultural development and the illegal collection of individuals from the wild for horticultural trade. The complex and specialised ecological requirements of CPs, together with the multifaceted threats they face, make conservation difficult and repatriation even to restored areas challenging. As the number of vulnerable, endangered and extinct carnivorous plant species continues to grow, despite significant conservation efforts in many regions and greater awareness of their ecological requirements, it is clear that a paradigm shift is required in our approach to the preservation of this unique group of plants in order to achieve long-term conservation successes.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"e01272","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Conservation","Restoration","Carnivorous plants","Insectivorous plants","Threatening processes"]},{"key":"U95IEX7I","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Gerding","lastName":"Michael"},{"firstName":"Baumgarten","lastName":" Gerd"},{"firstName":"Zecha","lastName":" Marius"},{"firstName":"Lübken","lastName":" Franz-Josef"},{"firstName":"Baumgarten","lastName":" Kathrin"},{"firstName":"Latteck","lastName":" Ralph"}],"title":"On the unusually bright and frequent noctilucent clouds in summer 2019 above Northern Germany","publication_title":"Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics","issn":"1364-6826","doi":"10.1016/j.jastp.2021.105577","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364682621000419","abstract_note":"Noctilucent Clouds (NLC) and Mesospheric Summer Echoes (MSE) are ice-related phenomena that occur occasionally in the mid-latitude summer mesopause region and more frequently in the polar regions. We observe both phenomena above our site at Kühlungsborn (Germany, 54.1°N, 11.8°E) by lidar and radar since 1997 and 1998, respectively. The NLC season 2019 turned out to be record-breaking with respect to different parameters. We observed the brightest NLC (backscatter coefficient at 532 nm of βmax≈54⋅10−10m-1sr-1 ), the longest continuous NLC (~11 h) and the largest occurrence rates in June (~20%). The seasonally averaged NLC height was found 600 m lower in altitude in 2019 compared to our long-term record. Consistent with the NLC data, radar observations of MSE showed unusually long-lasting echoes and a higher occurrence rate in June 2019. In contrast to our initial expectations, this increase of ice abundance in 2019 was not related to a generally stronger advection from higher latitudes. Mean winds observed by a nearby meteor radar were essentially weaker than in previous years, even though the winds were still typically southward during NLC. Instead, we found unusually low mean temperatures below 83 km altitude (and down to 75 km) being the main reason for these extraordinary observations. Furthermore, water vapor concentrations were slightly enhanced in June 2019. Low temperatures and enhanced water vapor may be caused by stronger upwelling in the upper mesosphere. However, there is no vertical wind data available. Low solar activity was also a factor that promoted these good NLC conditions. Overall, we judge this a singular event and not as an indicator for climate change. Temperature data in the mesopause region and below are taken from Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) on NASA's Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED) satellite as well as Earth Observing System (EOS) Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) onboard NASA's Aura satellite.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"105577","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mesospheredynamics","Mesospheric summer echoes","Noctilucent clouds"]},{"key":"CAVBVSU5","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"duPreez","lastName":" M."},{"firstName":"Nel","lastName":" R."},{"firstName":"Bouwman","lastName":" H."}],"title":"First report of metallic elements in loggerhead and leatherback turtle eggs from the Indian Ocean","publication_title":"Chemosphere","issn":"0045-6535","doi":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.01.106","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653518301231","abstract_note":"Bio-monitoring of pollutants in long-lived animals such as sea turtles is an important tool in ecotoxicology.

Eggs of the leatherback and loggerhead turtle that breed on the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa were analysed for 30 elements. The eggshells and egg contents of the loggerhead turtle, the smaller of the two species, had higher or significantly higher concentrations than leatherbacks, except for strontium - the reason is unknown. Elemental concentrations in eggshells and contents were the same or lower compared with other studies. The differences in concentrations in the egg contents and eggshells between the two species are likely due to different trophic levels, migration patterns, life histories, age, and growth, as well as differences in pollution sources and the uptake, retention and elimination characteristics of the different elements by the different species. We found no congruence between patterns in eggshells and corresponding egg contents, for both species. However, eggshells and egg contents showed congruence between species. The lack of congruence between eggshells and contents within each species precludes using eggshell concentrations as a proxy for egg content concentrations. Copper, strontium, and selenium occurred at concentrations higher than available toxic reverence values. Further research is warranted, including the analyses of POPs, as well as possible deme discrimination based on compositional pattern differences.

The main objective is to analyze how ecological communities have changed as a result of Quaternary climate variability and the resulting individual responses of species that compose them until reaching their current composition. The concept of community is discussed at first, in the framework of the different schools of ecological thinking, and the need for seeking empirical support in long-term ecological processes is highlighted. The discussion is focused on terms such as succession, community assembly, stability, resilience and domains of attraction. With this background, the ecological response of Quaternary ecosystems is analyzed with emphasis on novel Quaternary communities, the usefulness of chronosequences to reconstruct succession, recurrent community assembly and disassembly following the glacial-interglacial cycles, equilibrium or disequilibrium with climate, resilience and non-linear responses, and non-analog communities. It is concluded that deterministic hypothesis of community succession and assembly in equilibrium with climate are not supported by Quaternary evidence. Rather, community composition is constantly shifting under the effects of environmental change, in a permanent nonequilibrium dynamics resulting from idiosyncratic responses of species to climate shifts. A combination of niche features and random sampling from metacommunities, as proposed by the neutral theory o biodiversity, seems compatible with part of the available evidence.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"119-172","language":"en","automatic_tags":["communityassembly","chronosequences","community ecology","domains of attraction","long-term ecology","modelling","non-analogs","resilience","stability","succession","Synecology"]},{"key":"HQY67WV4","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"deMelo Ximenes","lastName":" Maria de Fátima Freire"},{"firstName":"de Araújo Galvão","lastName":" Josélio Maria"},{"firstName":"Inacio","lastName":" Cássio Lázaro Silva"},{"firstName":"Macêdo e Silva","lastName":" Virgínia Penéllope"},{"firstName":"Pereira","lastName":" Raíssa Liane do Nascimento"},{"firstName":"Pinheiro","lastName":" Marcos Paulo Gomes"},{"firstName":"de Medeiros Silva","lastName":" Marcel Miranda"},{"firstName":"Gomes","lastName":" Carlos Eduardo Simões"}],"title":"Arbovirus expansion: New species of culicids infected by the Chikungunya virus in an urban park of Brazil.","publication_title":"Acta Tropica","issn":"0001-706X","doi":"10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105538","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X20302916","abstract_note":"The Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses have been spreading in tropical regions, causing epidemics with high morbidity rates and fatal cases.

Mosquitoes were captured with a Shannon trap between 2 and 6 pm in seven months of 2019. The Chikungunya virus was investigated according to the protocol described by Lanciotti (2007).

We describe the prevailing forms of anthropogenic disturbance that affect forest organisms in the context of the geographic and evolutionary background that has shaped the degree to which forest species may be resilient to environmental change. The fate of Amazonian biodiversity will partly depend upon the interaction between land-use and climate change, and the extent to which seasonally-dry forests can retain immunity against catastrophic recurrent wildfires.

Understanding the fluvial sediment transport processes operating in the Amazon basin is critical because the Amazon basin has great research value for the sustainable development of local and global ecosystems. This study investigated changes in the mainstream sediment flux in the Amazon River system during 1996–2018. At the Óbidos gauge station (on the Amazon mainstream), sediment loading significantly increased during 1996–2007 (earlier half of the study period), but the trend then reversed and sediment loading decreased during 2007–2018 (later period). River runoff was relatively stable during 1996–2018. The monthly sediment load and sediment concentration at Óbidos were not synchronized with monthly runoff because of the asynchronism of the peak water discharges of the Solimões, Madeira, and Negro Rivers. We infer that the significant increase in sediment flux from the Solimões River was an important factor affecting the observed sediment increase at Óbidos during 1996–2007. Besides, the increasing wash-load sediment flux at Manacapuru (on the Amazon tributary) should be derived from the Middle and Lower Solimões River, because the sediment transport from the Upper Solimões River was decreasing. We also found that the reversal of the sediment load trend at Óbidos could be partly influenced by the decreasing trend of sediment transport from the Madeira River, and dam construction was one of the important causes. The reduced sediment loading in the Amazon mainstream will have major implications for the downstream ecosystem. Because planned dam constructions are expected to quadruple the number of dams in the Amazon basin, we suggest that the risk of wetland and muddy coast degradation caused by intensive hydropower development is an important pending issue.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"104804","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Degradation","Dam construction","Amazon River","Sediment transport","Trends"]},{"key":"RF5JM4MG","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Multini","lastName":"Laura Cristina"},{"firstName":"Wilke","lastName":" André Barretto Bruno"},{"firstName":"Marrelli","lastName":" Mauro Toledo"}],"title":"Neotropical Anopheles (Kerteszia) mosquitoes associated with bromeliad-malaria transmission in a changing world","publication_title":"Acta Tropica","issn":"0001-706X","doi":"10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105413","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X19314688","abstract_note":"Kerteszia is a neotropical subgenus of Anopheles composed of 12 species. The species in this subgenus are strongly associated with humid forests rich in epiphytic bromeliads. Forest fragmentation and anthropogenic changes can therefore have a negative impact on the abundance and survival of these mosquito species. Within this subgenus, four species are considered primary vectors of malaria: An. cruzii, An. bellator, An. homunculus and An. neivai. Malaria cases associated with Kerteszia species are often referred to as bromeliad malaria, a type of malaria reported to be endemic in the coastal rainforest of the neotropical region since the end of the nineteenth century. Although the incidence of bromeliad-malaria cases has decreased since the middle of the last century, autochthonous malaria cases continue to be registered every year. The complexity of the epidemiology of bromeliad malaria appears to be increasing as asymptomatic plasmodial infections and transmission of simian Plasmodium to humans have recently been reported. Kerteszia vector species have a great affinity for human beings and can be found in human-modified areas close to forest fragments such as in the Extra-Amazonian region of Brazil, Colombian pacific coast, and the Caribbean coast. Deforestation and forest fragmentation have been occurring continuously in the biomes of the neotropical region, and findings of Kerteszia species in dwellings are frequent in this region. Controlling the species in the Kerteszia subgenus is particularly difficult because they move frequently from natural to rural and peri-urban areas in search of blood sources, posing a challenge for the development of control strategies based on integrated vector management. Furthermore, as it has been shown that some Kerteszia species share similar morphological and genetic characteristics, the existence of a species complex formed by cryptic, sibling species within the Kerteszia group in different areas in the South and Southeast of Brazil cannot be ruled out. The existence of such a complex could represent an obstacle to the control of Kerteszia species and consequently to the elimination of bromeliad-malaria transmission in these regions. Here, we review publications that focus on the biology and ecology of Kerteszia malaria vectors and their association with human-modified areas and bromeliad-malaria transmission.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"105413","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Anophelescruzii","Anthropogenic changes","Forest fragmentation","Malaria transmission","Malaria vectors"]},{"key":"I2GXGX8W","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Dengzhong"},{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":" Zhaohui"},{"firstName":"Tan","lastName":" Debao"},{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":" Yongbo"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":" Chong"}],"title":"Comparison of carbon emissions from the southern and northern tributaries of the Three Gorge Reservoir over the Changjiang River Basin, China","publication_title":"Ecohydrology & Hydrobiology","issn":"1642-3593","doi":"10.1016/j.ecohyd.2019.01.008","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1642359317301040","abstract_note":"Greenhouse gas emissions from the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years because of concerns related to regional climate change and clean energy production.

The largest expanses of tropical peatlands are located in lowland areas of Southeast Asia and the Amazon basin. The Loreto Region of Amazonian Peru contains ~63,000 km2 of peatlands. However, little is known about the biogeochemistry of these peatlands, and in particular, the cycling of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), and their responses to hydrometeorological forcings. To address these knowledge gaps, we established an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower in a natural palm (Mauritia flexuosa L.f.) swamp peatland near Iquitos, Peru. Here, we report ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 flux observations for this Amazonian palm swamp peatland over a two-year period in relation to hydrometeorological forcings. Seasonal and short-term variations in hydrometeorological forcing had a strong effect on CO2 and CH4 fluxes. High air temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exerted an important limitation on photosynthesis during the dry season, while latent heat flux appeared to be insensitive to these climate drivers. Evidence from light-response analyses and flux partitioning support that photosynthetic activity was downregulated during dry conditions, while ecosystem respiration (RE) was either inhibited or enhanced depending on water table position. The cumulative net ecosystem CO2 exchange indicated that the peatland was a significant CO2 sink ranging from −465 (−279 to −651) g C m−2 y−1 in 2018 to −462 (−277 to −647) g C m−2 y−1 in 2019. The forest was a CH4 source of 22 (20 to 24) g C m−2 y−1, similar in magnitude to other tropical peatlands and larger than boreal and arctic peatlands. Thus, the annual carbon budget of this Amazonian palm swamp peatland appears to be a major carbon sink under current hydrometeorological conditions.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"108167","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Carbon dioxide","Methane","Eddy covariance","Amazonian peatland","Palm swamp"]},{"key":"UN9LVINQ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Linguet","lastName":"Laurent"},{"firstName":"Pousset","lastName":" Yannis"},{"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":" Christian"}],"title":"Identifying statistical properties of solar radiation models by using information criteria","publication_title":"Solar Energy","issn":"0038-092X","doi":"10.1016/j.solener.2016.02.038","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X1600147X","abstract_note":"The purpose of this article is to improve modeling of statistical properties of solar radiation models through the analysis of measurement data on the ground in the intertropical zone.

Yet, international trade in wood products has been growing, and forestry competes with other forest ecosystem services over limited freshwater resources. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to assess nations’ WFs of consumption of wood products, the sustainability of these WFs, and the VW flows associated with international trade in wood products. We account nations’ WFs of and VW trade in wood products with a Multi-regional Input-Output model (MRIO-forest) that tracks wood flows along global supply chains (production, processing, trade, and final uses) for the period 1997-2017 and assess the sustainability of the green and blue WF of wood products in 2017. The WF of wood production increased from 8.37 × 1011 m3/y in 1997 to 9.87 × 1011 m3/y in 2017. About 38% (3.76 × 1011 m3/y) of this WF relates to wood products for export (in 2017), which means that VW trade associated with wood products ranks in between agricultural and industrial products in absolute volumes. About 10% (9.9 × 1010 m³/y) of the green WF and 11% (3.4 × 109 m³/y) of the blue WF of wood products in 2017 are unsustainable, meaning that they are located in areas where the total green/blue WF exceeds the maximum sustainable green/blue WF. The unsustainable green WF occurs mainly in Germany, Indonesia, the Czech Republic and the UK, and mainly relates to coniferous sawnwood, paper and paperboard other than newsprint, fibreboard and non-coniferous sawnwood. The unsustainable blue WF, which is much smaller, occurs in the USA, Russia. Nigeria, Canada and India, and mainly relates to fuelwood, paper and paperboard other than newsprint, sawnwood and fibreboard. This study increases our understanding of how forest evaporation flows link to the final consumption of wood products and contributes to the wider debate on the allocation of freshwater resources in the global economy.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"104188","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Forestry","Timber","Multi-regional input-output","Virtual water trade","Water footprint","Wood"]},{"key":"XHZITRVD","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Fearnside","lastName":"P.

Here we review our understanding of the bioenergetics and feeding dynamics of tunas on a global scale, with an emphasis on yellowfin, bigeye, skipjack, albacore, and Atlantic bluefin tunas. Food consumption balances bioenergetics expenditures for respiration, growth (including gonad production), specific dynamic action, egestion, and excretion. Tunas feed across the micronekton and some large zooplankton. Some tunas appear to time their life history to take advantage of ephemeral aggregations of crustacean, fish, and molluscan prey. Ontogenetic and spatial diet differences are substantial, and significant interdecadal changes in prey composition have been observed. Diet shifts from larger to smaller prey taxa highlight ecosystem-wide changes in prey availability and diversity and provide implications for changing bioenergetics requirements into the future. Where tunas overlap, we show evidence of niche separation between them; resources are divided largely by differences in diet percentages and size ranges of prey taxa. The lack of long-term data limits the ability to predict impacts of climate change on tuna feeding behaviour. We note the need for systematic collection of feeding data as part of routine monitoring of these species, and we highlight the advantages of using biochemical techniques for broad-scale analyses of trophic relations. We support the continued development of ecosystem models, which all too often lack the regional-specific trophic data needed to adequately investigate climate and fishing impacts.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"199-344","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Bioenergetics","Food webs","Niche separation","Pelagic","Predator–prey","Stable isotope ecology","Trophic ecology","Tunas"]},{"key":"3WMCPZV4","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Manhães","lastName":"B.

The tailing mud flooded the Doce River basin and reached the sea in the coast of Espírito Santo State (ES), Southeast Brazil. This coastal region is the habitat of the most isolated population of franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei), with the lowest populational census and lowest genetic diversity in Franciscana Management Area Ia (FMA Ia) - 18° 25′S and 21° 17′S. This study aimed to assess the bioaccumulation of trace-elements (As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, and Zn) in muscle, liver and kidney of franciscana dolphins collected near the Doce River's mouth before (n = 32) and after (n = 19) the tailing mud reached the sea. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM) showed increasing temporal trends of Hg and Zn in muscle and liver after the dam failure, probably related to higher concentrations and bioavailability in the water column and sediments from the Doce River. Declining trends were found for As and Cu muscular and hepatic concentrations and Fe concentrations in kidney due to their lower bioavailability after the disaster, caused by association with tailings mud trapped in the riverbanks and suspended particulate material. Additionally, higher As and Hg concentrations found in the first period of sampling may be due to historical contamination by mining activities. The full extent of the impacts caused by the Fundão dam failure is still unknown. However, due to their rapid increase and remobilization process, toxic effects can be induced in the biota by these elements. Elements' bioaccumulation in this study contributes to the knowledge of franciscana dolphins from FMA Ia. Considering the conservation concern regarding this franciscana population and its scarce knowledge, the impact of this disaster can be alarming for species conservation.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"150196","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Franciscanadolphin","Franciscana Management Area","Fundão dam","Metals","Tailings mud","Western South Atlantic"]},{"key":"U3TZ2AM9","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Besset","lastName":"Manon"},{"firstName":"Gratiot","lastName":" Nicolas"},{"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":" Edward J."},{"firstName":"Bouchette","lastName":" Frédéric"},{"firstName":"Goichot","lastName":" Marc"},{"firstName":"Marchesiello","lastName":" Patrick"}],"title":"Mangroves and shoreline erosion in the Mekong River delta, Viet Nam","publication_title":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","issn":"0272-7714","doi":"10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106263","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771419301672","abstract_note":"The question of the rampant erosion of the shorelines rimming the Mekong River delta has assumed increasing importance over the last few years. Among issues pertinent to this question is how it is related to mangroves. Using high-resolution satellite images, we compared the width of the mangrove belt fringing the shoreline in 2012 to shoreline change (advance, retreat) between 2003 and 2012 for 3687 cross-shore transects, spaced 100 m apart, and thus covering nearly 370 km of delta shoreline bearing mangroves. The results show no significant relationships. We infer from this that, once erosion sets in following sustained deficient mud supply to the coast, the rate of shoreline change is independent of the width of the mangrove belt. Numerous studies have shown that: (1) mangroves promote coastal accretion where fine-grained sediment supply is adequate, (2) a large and healthy belt of fringing mangroves can efficiently protect a shoreline by inducing more efficient dissipation of wave energy than a narrower fringe, and (3) mangrove removal contributes to the aggravation of ongoing shoreline erosion. We fully concur, but draw attention to the fact that mangroves cannot accomplish their land-building and coastal protection roles under conditions of a failing sediment supply and prevailing erosion. Ignoring these overarching conditions implies that high expectations from mangroves in protecting and/or stabilizing the Mekong delta shoreline, and eroding shorelines elsewhere, will meet with disappointment. Among these false expectations are: (1) a large and healthy mangrove fringe is sufficient to stabilize the (eroding) shoreline, (2) a reduction in the width of a large mangrove fringe to the benefit of other activities, such as shrimp-farming, is not deleterious to the shoreline position, and (3) the effects of human-induced reductions in sediment supply to the coast can be offset by a large belt of fringing mangroves.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"106263","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mangroves","Coastal squeeze","Mekong river delta","Sediment supply","Shoreline erosion"]},{"key":"TTUIENEX","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Jie"},{"firstName":"Wan","lastName":" Shiming"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":" Anchun"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":" Tiegang"}],"title":"Two-phase structure of tropical hydroclimate during Heinrich Stadial 1 and its global implications","publication_title":"Quaternary Science Reviews","issn":"0277-3791","doi":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.105900","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379119303798","abstract_note":"Previous studies have proposed that the two-phase structure of Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) is a ubiquitous feature. However, few studies have focused on the internal structure of HS1 over a tropical domain; thus, the interhemispheric ocean-atmosphere teleconnections during HS1 are poorly defined. Here, we present high-resolution sedimentological, geochemical, and palaeoceanographic records from the core CG2 in the southern South China Sea (SCS), off the northern Sunda Shelf. The core continuously spans 9.0–22.0 ky BP. The records suggest two episodes of increased monsoon rainfall during the pre-HS1 (∼19.0–18.0 ky BP) and in the early HS1 (17.5–16.1 ky BP), along with a weaker monsoon rainfall during the late HS1 (16.1–14.7 ky BP). In contrast, a lower precipitation over the Flores Sea occurred during the early HS1, off the southern Sunda Shelf, followed by an enhanced precipitation runoff during the late HS1 (Muller et al., 2012). Notably, these two different precipitation phases characterise a southward Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shift over the Sunda Shelf during HS1. These changes are also consistent with other monsoon records, as well as other available data from the tropical to high latitudes of both hemispheres, supporting the global scope of the twofold HS1. We propose that the two episodes of intense monsoon rainfall over the northern Sunda Shelf during the pre-HS1 and the early HS1 observed in our study are closely linked to two different melting events associated with European ice sheet (EIS) retreat. We further propose that the subsequent maximum Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) reduction and the migration of the ITCZ to its southernmost position during the late HS1 are tightly connected with the destabilization of the marine-terminating ice-streams of the Laurentide ice sheet (LIS) in the North Atlantic. Tropical positive feedbacks during HS1, in turn, should have played an important role in sustaining the AMOC reduction and Northern Hemisphere (NH) stadial conditions, by continuously lowering the salinity of the low-latitude currents in the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, the tropical ITCZ appears to have been a key bridge in promoting interhemispheric climate connections, by which North Atlantic cooling was rapidly linked to increased Southern Ocean surface westerlies. This, in turn, drove upwelling and CO2 ventilation from the Southern Ocean, and thereby facilitated deglacial warming. Finally, these findings show that tropical climate variation is an important component of deglacial climate changes; understanding how it responds to millennial events like HS1 may help us better understand global teleconnections.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"105900","language":"en","automatic_tags":["AMOC","European ice sheet","HS1","Last deglaciation","Sunda shelf","Tropical ITCZ"]},{"key":"APKYG6CU","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Tsai","lastName":"Heng"},{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":" Jyun-Hong"},{"firstName":"Huang","lastName":" Wen-Shu"},{"firstName":"Huang","lastName":" Shiuh-Tsuen"},{"firstName":"Hseu","lastName":" Zeng-Yei"},{"firstName":"You","lastName":" Cheng-Feng"}],"title":"Aeolian additions of podzolic soils on the high-altitude mountains in central Taiwan-sediment origin and pedological implications","publication_title":"Geoderma","issn":"0016-7061","doi":"10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114726","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706119330502","abstract_note":"The podzolic soils with characteristic eluvial horizon are widely distributed in the mountainous area of Taiwan with a cold and humid climate, where the altitude is greater than 3000 m above sea level. There are multiple sequence horizons along the soil profile in some of the places. These repeated patterns of the soil horizons have not been reported in the literature, which may indicate the cycles of climatic or environmental changes in the past. The puzzling origin of these soils may be answered by identifying the parent materials and their source areas through age dating and isotopic analyses. Four soil profiles were sampled from Hohuanshan (HHM and HWS), Nanhuashan (NH), and Battonguan (BTG) of the alpine area in central Taiwan. These soils, in general, show the characteristics of silt and silty loam in soil texture, high soil organic carbon, low cation exchange capacity, and low base saturation percentage. Soil classification in accordance with the US System (Soil Taxonomy) suggests all the soils in this study are Humicryepts. The index quantification from soil morphology also shows the extent of pedogenesis fairly between profiles, which is supported by the ages obtained from the charcoals or highly carbonized woods in various sizes found in the dark black soil horizons. It suggests that these soils began to develop approximately four thousand years ago, during the cool and dry period of the Holocene according to the paleoclimate records, and the cold and dry climate favors the preservation of charcoals. Despite the suspicions of aeolian deposits in Taiwan, the high mountain areas are far from the location of aeolian deposits. It was not until recent years that the researchers proposed the idea of aeolian addition to the soils in Hohuanshan. The characteristics of the multiple sequence soil horizons may offer an insight into the paleoenvironment of the high mountain areas. The bimodal pattern on the particle size distribution indicates an additional parental source for these soils. The evidence from the calculated strontium isotope ratios delivers an argument that these soils are developed by in-situ weathering with the addition of aeolian material. They are yellowish and subangular particles with sizes ranging from 7 to 10 µm. The aeolian deposits of Hohuanshan reveal the geochemical characteristics of the river sediments of the Da-An, Da-Chia, Da-Du River, and Cho-Shui Rivers. This suggests that the source of the aeolian particles in the soils was supplied with materials connected with the river system of central Taiwan. In the same manner, the aeolian deposits of Nanhuashan and Battonguan were likely derived from the river sediments of eastern Taiwan. The example from the NH profile indicates a constant rate of aeolian addition, which rules out the influence of the fluctuations of climate change since the mid-Holocene. The findings of this study not only help validate previous studies on the paleoenvironment of Taiwan but also inspire further aspects of the Taiwanese paleoclimate researches.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"114726","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Strontiumisotope","Aeolian","Pedogenesis climatic change","Podzolic soil","Soil development index"]},{"key":"Z5N4HGLP","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Pham","lastName":"Van Hieu"},{"firstName":"Luu","lastName":" Viet Dung"},{"firstName":"Nguyen","lastName":" Tai Tue"},{"firstName":"Koji","lastName":" Omori"}],"title":"Will restored mangrove forests enhance sediment organic carbon and ecosystem carbon storage?","publication_title":"Regional Studies in Marine Science","issn":"2352-4855","doi":"10.1016/j.rsma.2017.05.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352485517300610","abstract_note":"Mangrove forests are among the largest carbon (C) sinks in (sub) tropical areas, playing a vital role in reducing C emissions. However, these forests have degraded rapidly in recent decades due to various human activities and natural disturbances. Thus, mangrove restoration programs have been widely initiated to prevent further forest loss and to mitigate climate change. The measurement of ecosystem C storage in restored mangrove forests will provide crucial information for the temporal reporting of C emissions in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) schemes. The question whether restored mangrove forests enhance sediment organic carbon (OC) and ecosystem C storage has not been resolved for mangrove restoration programs. The present study, therefore, aimed to quantify ecosystem C storage and the contribution of organic matter sources to sedimentary OC in Kandelia obovata forests aged 9, 19 and 27 years; Sonneratia caseolaris forests aged 2 and 3 years, and a reference mudflat forest aged 0 from Hau Loc, North-Central Vietnam. The mean above- and below-ground C stocks of these forests ranged from 12.7±2.4 to 107.5±10.7MgCha−1, and 103.8±2.9 to 412.4±6.5MgCha−1, respectively. The ecosystem C storage of mangrove forests tended to increase with stand age, ranging from 201.3±4.3 to 519.9±12.5MgCha−1, with an overall mean of 310.3±21.3MgCha−1. The contribution of mangrove litter to sedimentary OC was between 45.8±0.8 and 64.1±1.5% along a forest chronosequence. The increase of the OC content and ecosystem C storage, and the proportional contributions of OC sources with forest age resulted from higher biomass production following forest development and the location of stands in the intertidal zone. These findings highlighted the importance of mangrove restoration programs in enhancing the ecosystem C storage and the sediment OC.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"43-52","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Organiccarbon","Carbon storage","Chronosequence","Restored mangrove forests","Stable isotope","Vietnam"]},{"key":"EICF3SZQ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Hoang-Anh"},{"firstName":"Gratiot","lastName":" Nicolas"},{"firstName":"Santini","lastName":" William"},{"firstName":"Ribolzi","lastName":" Olivier"},{"firstName":"Tran","lastName":" Duc"},{"firstName":"Meriaux","lastName":" Xavier"},{"firstName":"Deleersnijder","lastName":" Eric"},{"firstName":"Soares-Frazão","lastName":" Sandra"}],"title":"Suspended sediment properties in the Lower Mekong River, from fluvial to estuarine environments","publication_title":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","issn":"0272-7714","doi":"10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106522","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771419306171","abstract_note":"The Mekong river is one of the largest rivers in the world, which flows through six countries of Southeast Asia (China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam).

This study confirms that suspended sediment transported in the LMR are predominantly (75% by volume) flocculi (or freshly eroded soils aggregates), with median aggregated particle size in the range 10–20 μm and median settling velocity of the order of 0.01–0.1 mm s−1. These flocculi are robust under the hydrodynamic conditions (turbulence and suspended sediment concentration – SSC) existing in the LMR. Laboratory investigations reveal the existence of a threshold sediment concentration (400 mg.L−1), beyond which flocculation and sedimentation increase of orders of magnitudes. Thus, concentration that exceeds this threshold might promote the formation of so-called fluid mud layers. Because of the nonlinear response of flocculation and sedimentation with SSC and considering the ongoing changes at a regional scale in the LMR, higher occurrence of fluid mud layers in the fluvial upstream waterbodies might be anticipated, and a lower occurrence in estuaries and alongshore where the concentration decrease. The geomorphology could be impacted, with an over-siltation in dams and an exacerbated erosion of the muddy-mangrove coast.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"106522","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Flocculation","Fluid mud layer","LISST","Mekong","SCAF","Settling velocity"]},{"key":"4NTKSH8G","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Allard","lastName":"Thierry"},{"firstName":"Gautheron","lastName":" Cécile"},{"firstName":"Bressan Riffel","lastName":" Silvana"},{"firstName":"Balan","lastName":" Etienne"},{"firstName":"Soares","lastName":" Bruna Fernandes"},{"firstName":"Pinna-Jamme","lastName":" Rosella"},{"firstName":"Derycke","lastName":" Alexis"},{"firstName":"Morin","lastName":" Guillaume"},{"firstName":"Bueno","lastName":" Guilherme Taitson"},{"firstName":"do Nascimento","lastName":" Nadia"}],"title":"Combined dating of goethites and kaolinites from ferruginous duricrusts.

Three samples collected at different elevations in the landscape were selected. The goethite corrected ages range from 1.1–15.2 Ma and consistently increase with elevation. EPR was performed on kaolinites after several cycles of a deferration procedure. Considering extreme geochemical scenarii, the ages of kaolinites are 1.7–7.1 Ma for a closed system and 4.0–16.7 Ma for an open system with 100% Rn loss. Ages of goethites and kaolinites are close, in the limit of the uncertainty of the methods. They show important periods of duricrust formation at Middle Miocene and at Late Miocene/Pliocene. Data allow the estimation of lowering rates between 3 and 8 m/Ma, in agreement with independent data available in the literature for the central Amazonia region or even for erosion of other cratons in the world.

In both mitigation scenarios, a global uniform carbon tax has been applied as a proxy of pressure on the system to induce a variety of mitigation measures — assuming the presence of some international mechanism for globally cost-efficient implementation of such measures. The two scenarios differ in the timing of mitigation action: early action versus delayed response. Analysis of the scenarios has led to the following findings. First, stabilisation at a carbon dioxide concentration of 450ppmv from the B1 baseline scenario is technically feasible. In the first quarter/second quarter of this century most of the reduction will come from energy-efficiency and fuel switching options; later on the introduction of carbon-free supply options will account for the bulk of the required reductions. Second, postponing measures foregoes the benefits of learning-by-doing, and, as a result, an early action strategy will at low discount rates lead to reduced mitigation costs compared to delayed response. The most difficult period for the mitigation scenarios is the 2010–2040 period (exact timing depends on early action or delayed response), when ‘bending the curve’ towards a lower carbon emission system will have to be initiated. Finally, while overall costs seems to be limited, there are large differences in costs and benefits for individual regions and sectors for instance in terms of redirection of investments, changing fuel trade patterns and changing energy expenditures.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"189-210","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Energy modelling","IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)","Mitigation","Technology development"]},{"key":"CXMMDCVN","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2013","author":[{"firstName":"Cohen","lastName":"R."},{"firstName":"Kaino","lastName":" J."},{"firstName":"Okello","lastName":" J.

Participation in REDD+will require developing countries to produce robust estimates of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) accompanied by an appropriate measure of uncertainty. Final estimates of AGB should account for known sources of uncertainty (measurement and predictive) particularly when estimating AGB at large spatial scales. In this study, mixed-effects models were used to account for variability in the allometric relationship of Kenyan mangroves due to species and site effects. A generic biomass equation for Kenyan mangroves was produced in addition to a set of species-site specific equations. The generic equation has potential for broad application as it can be used to predict the AGB of new trees where there is no pre-existing knowledge of the specific species-site allometric relationship: the most commonly encountered scenario in practical biomass studies. Predictions of AGB using the mixed-effects model showed good correspondence with the original observed values of AGB although displayed a poorer fit at higher AGB values, suggesting caution in extrapolation. A strong relationship was found between the observed and predicted values of AGB using an independent validation dataset from the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique (R2=0.96, p= <0.001). The simulation based approach to uncertainty propagation employed in the current study produced estimates of AGB at different spatial scales (tree – landscape level) accompanied by a realistic measure of the total uncertainty. Estimates of mangrove AGB in Kenya are presented at the plot, regional and landscape level accompanied by 95% prediction intervals. The 95% prediction intervals for landscape level estimates of total AGB stocks suggest that between 5.4 and 7.2 megatonnes of AGB is currently held in Kenyan mangrove forests.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"968-982","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mangrove","Above-ground biomass","Allometric equations","Kenya","Mixed-effects models","Uncertainty propagation"]},{"key":"3YVR7URS","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Pérez-Emán","lastName":"Jorge L."},{"firstName":"Lentino","lastName":" Miguel"},{"firstName":"Bonaccorso","lastName":" Elisa"}],"title":"Chapter 13 - Birds","publication_title":"Biodiversity of Pantepui","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128155912000136","abstract_note":"The avifauna of Pantepui is an extraordinary assemblage characterized by high endemism, which likely originated through complex ecological and evolutionary processes.

However, compared to temperate cities, the drivers of urban tree species distribution in tropical cities remain understudied. In this study, we quantify the spatial distribution and abundance of urban forests in the tropical city of Georgetown, Guyana. British colonialism has shaped this city, including forced movement of peoples under slavery from Africa and indentured servants from the Indian Subcontinent. We studied how this multicultural context has influenced tree species distributions in the capital city of the only Anglophone country in South America. We quantified the abundance of tree species using a stratified sampling design to distribute transects across fifteen neighborhoods that vary in distance to the colonial center of the city and ethnic composition. We recorded a total of 57 unique species, the majority of which (73%) were cultivated for their edible fruits. We identify tree species that likely represent Guyana’s unique multicultural heritage by comparing our species list to flora in nine cities in neighboring countries (Venezuela and Brazil) with different colonial histories. This international comparison identified a set of tree species that occurred only in Guyana. Relationships between ethnic composition and colonial history and tree species distribution were weak at the neighborhood scale, where proportion of East Indian residents had little explanatory power and distance to colonial center was correlated with abundance of only some species groups. This apparent discrepancy between neighborhood and national scales may relate to the establishment of Guyanese food as a unifying national identifier across ethnicities. The prominence of edible fruit trees in our study suggests a set of species that could be incorporated into urban planning to strengthen biocultural linkages, foster cultural integration, and promote food security.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"313-322","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Guyana","Colonialism","Biocultural diversity","Edible green infrastructure","Ethnicity","Urban forests"]},{"key":"BRUA3IJ6","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Mayle","lastName":"Francis E."},{"firstName":"Iriarte","lastName":" José"}],"title":"Integrated palaeoecology and archaeology – a powerful approach for understanding pre-Columbian Amazonia","publication_title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","issn":"0305-4403","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2012.08.038","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312003913","abstract_note":"The old paradigm that Amazonia's tropical ecosystems prevented cultural development beyond small-scale shifting agricultural economies, that had little environmental impact, no longer holds true for much of Amazonia.

There is a common, yet dubious expectation that mangrove restoration will result in immediate and perpetual delivery of ecosystem services. There are expected time lags between mangrove clearing and C and N losses, and between restoration and C and N gains. Obtaining accurate rates of losses and gains requires frequent and long-term sampling, which is expensive and time consuming. To address this knowledge gap, we used a chronosequence of mangrove forests in mangroves in Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Malaysia, a region with one of the most C dense forests in the world. In this site, we assessed the ecosystem C and N stocks, including soil, downed wood, downed litter, and trees. The objective was to measure C and N changes through time. After mangrove clearing, C and N losses in soil and downed wood were rapid, with stocks halved after just one year. In the first 10 years after replantation, the forest recovered quickly, with rates of C accumulation of 9.5 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. After ten years, the rate of accumulation decreased to 2.8 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. However, 40 years after replantation, mangroves were still about 26% lower in C and 15% lower in N compared to our reference forest. The trajectory of recovery of C and N stocks in these forests was different among mangrove components: forest litter recovered rapidly, but downed wood and soil recovered much slower. Programs aimed at reducing C emissions and N pollution should consider that there are temporal lags and ecosystem trade-offs when assessing the effectiveness of mangrove protection and restoration as climate change mitigation strategies.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"117-126","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"VGFSJ44Z","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"deFreitas Assad","lastName":" Luiz Paulo"},{"firstName":"Toste","lastName":" Raquel"},{"firstName":"Böck","lastName":" Carina Stefoni"},{"firstName":"Nehme","lastName":" Douglas Medeiros"},{"firstName":"Sancho","lastName":" Lívia"},{"firstName":"Soares","lastName":" Anderson Elias"},{"firstName":"Landau","lastName":" Luiz"}],"title":"Ocean climatology at Brazilian Equatorial Margin: A numerical approach","publication_title":"Journal of Computational Science","issn":"1877-7503","doi":"10.1016/j.jocs.2020.101159","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750320304609","abstract_note":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the main aspects of the mesoscale ocean circulation of the Brazilian Equatorial Margin using a ten-year hydrodynamic hindcast that successfully represented in situ and satellite observational data.

In seeking solutions to restore the degradation of the environment, we need to consider the interconnecting nature of the various ecosystems and be aware of the developments in various allied disciplines and how these may impact on developing and implementing sound engineering solutions to various environmental problems. The impact of the exploitation and utilization of the natural systems by nations on the depletion of natural resources; elimination of species; flora and fauna local and regional changes; and deterioration of the environment through solid and liquid waste, air and water pollution, and by greenhouse gases is summarized with case studies from around the world. It is also highlighted that the impacts upon the natural systems vary geographically, depending on the existing states of both the natural environment and the economy, but in many cases these impacts extend to a regional or even a global scale. This chapter also discusses evidences of global environmental impacts such as: (a) pollution of air, land, and water, due to accidents during the transportation of oil or other products by ship, plastic debris in the rivers and oceans, effluent discharge into fresh water bodies; (b) water scarcity and degradation; (c) growing quantities of wastes as a result of chemical product utilizations in all human activities, from agriculture to medicine, to energy and industrial and manufacturing processes, to everyday products; (d) trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste; (e) acid rain; (f) deforestation and land degradation; (g) desertification and soil erosion; (h) depletion of the ozone layer; and (i) the decreasing species of wildlife. The greatest emphasis is given here to global warming and climate change, where, according to all scientific evidence the question no longer is if, but how abruptly a global climate change will happen. Several examples are provided of the most recent information on glaciers and ice sheets melting, extremes in the hydrologic cycle, rise in sea temperature and level, and flora and fauna changes as result of the global warming. This chapter also provides references and excerpts from important national and international conventions and legislation regarding the topics addressed. We further discuss the interconnections between global environmental problems and highlight the importance of the following:1.Current processes are characterized by a nonlinear behavior and we lack the scientific understanding to predict what alterations in one would entail for another process. This means that we do not know the tipping point, which when reached changes can become unpredictable and the magnitude and impact of events may not be of the same order of what was experienced in the past.2.If the present generation does not come up with adequate protective measures and solutions, and the environment continues to deteriorate on a global scale, many unpredictable events of large scale can eventually be faced by the next generation altering drastically its living conditions. Therefore it is urgent to comprehensively step up conservation efforts of the global environment, with a far-reaching long-term perspective that transcends the generations.3.Development of solutions to restore the degradation of the environment is complicated by the interconnecting nature of the various ecosystems, i.e., atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere that constitute the land. This means that a cooperative and holistic global effort should be considered in developing a viable solution to global environmental problems.4.Global environmental issues interlock in forming a group of issues which, with the joint cooperation of the international community, need to be comprehensively addressed under a broad and long-term perspective. It is important that all nations take up conservation of the global environment as an important policy task and take initiatives in realizing sustainable development on a global scale. All of the above pose great challenges to modern geoenvironmental engineers as they need to expand significantly their traditional knowledge base and professional role to consider as integral part of their activities an assessment of projects' impact on ecosystems, air, water, and land, and in many cases, consider this beyond a limited, local level. We hope that this chapter aids in this goal of promoting a new definition of geoenvironmental engineering that is urgently needed to address current needs.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"3-42","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Globalwarming","Climate change","Deforestation","Green economies and societies","Hydrologic cycle","Land degradation","Land environment and resources","Sustainable development index","Trans-boundary chemical and waste movement"]},{"key":"2ES3HE5M","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"NouraGuimarães","lastName":" Lucas"}],"title":"Chapter 1 - Is there a Latin American electricity transition?

The subcontinent has not managed to diversify away from fossil fuels and climate-sensitive hydropower, in order to guarantee an environmental-friendly energy security. The Latin American countries find themselves in different stages of market developments, have scattered and diverse renewable energy sources, and seek different electricity transitions within different time frames. This chapter shows that Latin American countries still have a lot to grow in terms of grid interconnection and energy exchange, developments of which might build common ground for a Latin American electricity transition. In the pursue of economic development fueled by renewable energy sources, the region needs to avoid the “transition-related renewables curse,” being paramount to analyze from which diversification stakeholders are talking about, so the maintenance and growth of the renewables’ share in the electricity matrixes of countries are not hampered.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"3-20","language":"en","automatic_tags":["LatinAmerica","diversification","electricity transition","energy transition","grid interconnection","intraregional differences","renewable energy sources"]},{"key":"4JEMRDC6","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Guimarães","lastName":"Victor Yunes"},{"firstName":"de Albuquerque","lastName":" Ana Cláudia Alexandre"},{"firstName":"do Vale e Silva","lastName":" Alexandre Henrique Cardoso"},{"firstName":"Wilmsen","lastName":" Maurício Orlando"},{"firstName":"Lux Hoppe","lastName":" Estevam G."},{"firstName":"Takahira","lastName":" Regina Kiomi"}],"title":"Island and Riverine populations of Alouatta belzebul from the Brazilian Amazon parasitized by Pediculus mjobergi","publication_title":"Veterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports","issn":"2405-9390","doi":"10.1016/j.vprsr.2020.100476","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405939020302574","abstract_note":"Mammalian lice are obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that remain on the host throughout the life cycle.

Disease due to Histoplasma is termed histoplasmosis. The fungus is thermally dimorphic as it typically exists as a mold in the environment, which transitions to a yeast form during histoplasmosis in warm-blooded animals. Among the endemic dimorphic MYCO-Sses, histoplasmosis is one of the most frequently clinically encountered. Significantly, those in endemic areas are at extremely high risk for acquiring the fungus, but clinical disease remains uncommon. Nevertheless, there are ~1500 hospitalizations per year in the USA. Severity of disease is correlated with the infectious inoculum, with high dose acquisition leading to more frequent disease. Disease severity is also linked to the virulence of individual strains as well as the immunological state of the acutely or latently infected individual, with serious disease being more common in individuals with advanced HIV infection or on drugs that suppress immune functions, such as inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-α. Moreover, reactivation of latent infection is a major risk in immunosuppressed individuals. Gold-standard techniques for histoplasmosis diagnosis include direct visualization of the fungus or culture isolation from clinical samples. Immunodiagnostic techniques, including immunodiffusion, complement fixation, and new lateral flow tests, assist with the presumptive diagnosis. Treatment depends on the severity of disease, with itraconazole being used in moderate and amphotericin B in more serious manifestations of histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis remains an understudied and neglected pathogen that merits ongoing study to more fully understand the pathobiology of the fungus, to develop sensitive, rapid and specific diagnostics and more effective therapeutic strategies.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"624-628","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Dimorphic","Endemic","Fungus","Histoplasma","Histoplasmosis","Host-pathogen interaction","Microbial pathogenesis","Mold","Mycosis","Pneumonia","Sepsis","Yeast"]},{"key":"5YFCQ6YM","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2012","author":[{"firstName":"Ramirez-Villegas","lastName":"Julian"},{"firstName":"Jarvis","lastName":" Andy"},{"firstName":"Touval","lastName":" Jerry"}],"title":"Analysis of threats to South American flora and its implications for conservation","publication_title":"Journal for Nature Conservation","issn":"1617-1381","doi":"10.1016/j.jnc.2012.07.006","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1617138112000830","abstract_note":"South America houses a significant proportion of the world's plant diversity and therefore merits conservation attention. However, ongoing habitat fragmentation, degradation and destruction of natural habitats threaten biodiversity. A set of seven threats to natural ecosystems derived from a previous study (Jarvis et al. 2010), combined with a dataset of occurrences from 16,339 species, and also with the World Database of Protected Areas were used to analyse the patterns of threats to flora in South America and its conservation. Species richness per ∼50km side cell ranged from 1 to 2149 taxa, but with most of the areas presenting between 1 and 58 taxa. Population accessibility, expansion of agriculture and grazing pressure were found to be the key drivers of immediate extinction risk. A considerable (78.4%) number of species presented at least one population under high threat due to the expansion and intensification of these anthropogenic activities. In addition, some 13.8% of the analysed species presented up to 80% of their populations at risk of extinction (high threat index). On the conservation side, 82.3% of the analysed taxa have at least one population occurring within a protected site. However, it is important to note that for a protected area system to be effective and efficient, the conservation of within-taxon genetic diversity is required. The expansion, monitoring and strengthening of 24 existing protected areas holding up to 70% of South American plant diversity is suggested; as is the revision of seven additional sites where up to 200 species not currently conserved are present. Critical areas to monitor, expand and strengthen are mainly located in the Ecuadorian and Colombian Andes, southern Paraguay, the Guyana shield, southern Brazil, and Bolivia.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"337-348","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Protectedareas","Species richness","Extinction","Agriculture","Anthropogenic activities","Diversity","Populations"]},{"key":"CJRKQM6J","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yuchen"},{"firstName":"Runting","lastName":" Rebecca K."},{"firstName":"Webb","lastName":" Edward L."},{"firstName":"Edwards","lastName":" David P."},{"firstName":"Carrasco","lastName":" L.

A key question is how to reconcile these potentially competing goals spatially. We use integer linear programming to develop an ‘integrated land use planning framework’ that identifies the optimal allocation of 17 crops under different hypothetical conservation targets while meeting agricultural demands by 2030. Intensifying existing cropland to maximum yield before allocating new cropland would reduce land requirement by 43% versus cropland expansion without intensification. Even with yield gap closure, tropical and sub-tropical crops still require expansion, primarily allocated to Venezuela, eastern Brazil, Congo Basin, Myanmar and Indonesia. Enforcement of protected areas, via avoiding conversion in 75% of Key Biodiversity Areas and 65% of intact areas, is vital to attain biodiversity targets but bears large opportunity costs, with agricultural rents dropping from $4.1 to $2.8 trillion. Although nationally constrained forest conservation efforts would earn 9% less agricultural rents compared to globally coordinated conservation solutions, they were also able to reduce intact habitat and forest loss (43% and 35% reduction). Our results demonstrate that careful choice of the allocation of future cropland expansion, could dramatically reduce—but not eliminate—the tradeoffs between the SDGs for food production and land biodiversity conservation.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"112032","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Agriculturalintensification","Land-use systems","Modelisation","Scenarios","Spatial optimization","Telecoupling"]},{"key":"8LHLJ88X","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Abessa","lastName":"Denis Moledo de Souza"},{"firstName":"Ambrozevicius","lastName":" Andrea Pimenta"}],"title":"Chapter 10 - Government initiative and policies on water conservation and wastewater treatment in Brazil","publication_title":"Water Conservation and Wastewater Treatment in BRICS Nations","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128183397000102","abstract_note":"This chapter aims to describe the water management and conservation in Brazil and show how the public policies evolved along time.

During pre-full glacial times, environmental changes in savannas were spatially complex. Some records show either stable grassland, where forest exists today, or a repeated alternation between forest, and savanna. During the full glacial period, neotropical savannas, both north and south of the equator, expanded because of markedly drier conditions. In the southern neotropical regions, savanna area was reduced, and replaced by subtropical grassland by cold climatic conditions during glacial periods. During the late glacial period, climate changed to wetter conditions north of equator earlier at 16,000-14,000 14C B.P., in montane regions. Wetter conditions were not recorded in the high plains or lowlands. During the early Holocene, the climate was drier in most of the South American savannas. Early Holocene distribution of savanna was much larger than during the late Holocene. The general synchrony of paleoenvironmental changes since the full glacial period, from neotropical savanna sites north and south of the equator, suggests changes in the latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) may have played an important role. The movement of the high pressure cell over the South Atlantic, and changes in frequency of the tracks of the Antarctic cold fronts were also important.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"307-323","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"6JT6CVIY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Guadalupe","lastName":"Vicente"},{"firstName":"Sotta","lastName":" Eleneide Doff"},{"firstName":"Santos","lastName":" Valdenira Ferreira"},{"firstName":"Gonçalves Aguiar","lastName":" Leonardo José"},{"firstName":"Vieira","lastName":" Marta"},{"firstName":"de Oliveira","lastName":" Cinthia Pereira"},{"firstName":"Nascimento Siqueira","lastName":" João Vitor"}],"title":"REDD+ implementation in a high forest low deforestation area: Constraints on monitoring forest carbon emissions","publication_title":"Land Use Policy","issn":"0264-8377","doi":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.02.015","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837716306007","abstract_note":"Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+), is still a promising mechanism of the UNFCCC for many tropical countries that would like to receive a fair financial compensation for their historical and current efforts to avoid forest conversion at the expense of more economically land uses. Brazil has a great opportunity to successfully participate in REDD+ not only because of its huge Amazon forest area (ca. 4 million km2) but also because of its advanced forest monitoring system “PRODES”. However, this opportunity could be threatened due to the current differentiated monitoring capacities of most Brazilian Amazon states, markedly in High-Forest and Low-Deforestation (HFLD) regions. This is evident in the State of Amapá, which despite its political will to support actions towards the design of its REDD+ strategy, is still struggling with key technical aspects of forest monitoring. To address this issue and to strengthen the on-going REDD+ design process we assessed a) land use and land cover (LULC) changes for period of 23 years (1985–2008); b) estimated CO2 emissions associated to these LULC changes; c) identified the main drivers and agents of deforestation, and d) discussed policy implications for REDD+ implementation in a HFLD area. We applied a methodology, which is capable of reducing cloud cover using temporal filters on the classified images, detecting deforestation (and forest degradation) in areas as small as 1 ha, and used the decision tree method to identify different LULC types. This methodology was able to demonstrate that forest cover in northern Amapá has remained almost untouched during the observed period of 23-years. As many other HFLD areas, this region has a great potential to receive financial benefits from the REDD+ mechanism, especially from voluntary markets that are largely interested in the conservation value of these areas. However, the use of high accuracy LULC classification approaches, with appropriate Measuring, Reporting and Verification systems should be part of the REDD+ implementation strategy of HFLD areas towards having high standards for certified carbon, and therefore improved chances to receive better prices for carbon offsets. The potential of REDD+ to be a fair and efficient mechanism will also depend on the recognition of the historical efforts to avoid deforestation in HFLD areas, mainly by Federal Governments, as an incentive for low-carbon development.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"414-421","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Deforestation","REDD+","Remote sensing","Low CO emissions","LULC classification"]},{"key":"E99CIL8L","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2013","author":[{"firstName":"Torres","lastName":"Vladimir"},{"firstName":"Hooghiemstra","lastName":" Henry"},{"firstName":"Lourens","lastName":" Lucas"},{"firstName":"Tzedakis","lastName":" P.

An astronomically tuned age model has been developed by using the visual correlation of the temperature-constrained record of Alnus with the benthic δ18O stacked record of ODP Site 846 and 849 for the last 1 million year (Ma). In addition, spectral analysis of the arboreal pollen percentages (AP%) prior to 1 Ma shows two consistent peaks at 7.6 and 9.5 m, which could either be interpreted as reflecting the 19 and 23-kyr components of the precession cycle or the 41-kyr cycle of obliquity. Evidence for precession forcing comes from the sum of the filtered 7.6 and 9.5 m cycles, revealing a long-term modulation that can be linked to the short-term (100-kyr) and long-term (400-kyr) eccentricity cycles. A precession-forced scenario, however, is not consistent with zircon fission-track ages and is difficult to explain in terms of climate forcing mechanisms. On the contrary, an obliquity control of the AP% record is consistent with the fission-track ages and with glacial–interglacial-bound temperature changes within the study region. Accordingly, it appears that the Funza09 record extends back to ∼2.25 Ma during which four periods with distinct different depositional environments could be identified, following a chronological poorly constrained interval of fluvial and fluvio-lacustrine sediments. From ∼2.25 to ∼1.47 Ma sediment deposition occurred in an area of wetlands dissected by fluvial channels and swamps. The strongest subsidence of the basin occurred between ∼1.47 and ∼1.23 Ma when a proper lake developed. Lacustrine sediments accumulated in water up to 50 m deep between ∼1.23 and ∼0.86 Ma. Hereafter, water depth was generally lower than 50 m, but fluctuated in conjunction with the 100-kyr dominated glacial–interglacial variability during the middle and late Pleistocene. The evolutionary changes of the páramo and montane forest biomes are described in terms of five characteristic stages. Most of the Pleistocene vegetation has no analogue to modern assemblages principally due to the late immigration events of Alnus (1.01 Ma) and Quercus (0.43 Ma) and we conclude that forest composition similar to modern was not established until the Last Interglacial. However, modern ecological constraints of suites of taxa that formed the vegetation of the pre-MIS 5 part of the record allow a reconstruction of environmental and climate change.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"59-72","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Colombia","Biome evolution","Biostratigraphy","Cyclostratigraphy","Land–sea correlation","Long continental pollen record","No-analogue vegetation","Orbital tuning","Pleistocene"]},{"key":"F5EULA7U","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Sist","lastName":"Plinio"},{"firstName":"Mazzei","lastName":" Lucas"},{"firstName":"Blanc","lastName":" Lilian"},{"firstName":"Rutishauser","lastName":" Ervan"}],"title":"Large trees as key elements of carbon storage and dynamics after selective logging in the Eastern Amazon","publication_title":"Forest Ecology and Management","issn":"0378-1127","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2014.01.005","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714000073","abstract_note":"The long term effect of Reduced-Impact Logging (RIL) on above-ground live biomass (AGB) dynamics was investigated in 18 1-ha logged over permanent sample plots set up in a terra firme rain forest in the Eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas). Both tree survival and growth were investigated among three Diameter at Breath Height (DBH) classes (20–40, 40–60, ⩾60cm) to assess the contribution of each DBH class to the post-logging AGB recovery. Before logging, mean tree density and AGB per plot (dbh⩾20cm) were 187±14 trees ha−1 and 377.6±62.8Mgha−1 respectively. Although big trees (dbh⩾60cm) only represented 9.3% of the total tree density, they gathered almost half of total AGB. During the post-logging period (8years), the mortality of large trees was found to drive the annual net changes and largely overcame the AGB gain in the smaller DBH classes. Indeed, plots with high post-logging mortality of large trees showed negative carbon balance t over the study period (8years). The over mortality of large trees injured by logging contributed significantly to the annual AGB losses (up to 40%) in the first years after logging. Due to the overwhelming importance of this size class in carbon stocks and dynamic, reducing logging damages and intensity might have great impact in the post-logging biomass dynamics. We estimated that reducing logging intensity from 6 to 3 stems ha−1 would save 27.7Mg C ha−1 for a 35years rotation cycle. To compensate this loss of profits, compensatory payments of avoided CO2 emission should worth US $ 6.5/Mg of CO2. This price falls into the range of prices of the international carbon market.

In this paper, we explore some of the issues associated with the conceptualisation and modelling of coastal morphological change at time and space scales relevant to managers and policy makers. Firstly, we revisit the question of how to define the most appropriate scales at which to seek quantitative predictions of landform change within an age defined by human interference with natural sediment systems and by the prospect of significant changes in climate and ocean forcing. Secondly, we consider the theoretical bases and conceptual frameworks for determining which processes are most important at a given scale of interest and the related problem of how to translate this understanding into models that are computationally feasible, retain a sound physical basis and demonstrate useful predictive skill. In particular, we explore the limitations of a primary scale approach and the extent to which these can be resolved with reference to the concept of the coastal tract and application of systems theory. Thirdly, we consider the importance of different styles of landform change and the need to resolve not only incremental evolution of morphology but also changes in the qualitative dynamics of a system and/or its gross morphological configuration. The extreme complexity and spatially distributed nature of landform systems means that quantitative prediction of future changes must necessarily be approached through mechanistic modelling of some form or another. Geomorphology has increasingly embraced so-called ‘reduced complexity’ models as a means of moving from an essentially reductionist focus on the mechanics of sediment transport towards a more synthesist view of landform evolution. However, there is little consensus on exactly what constitutes a reduced complexity model and the term itself is both misleading and, arguably, unhelpful. Accordingly, we synthesise a set of requirements for what might be termed ‘appropriate complexity modelling’ of quantitative coastal morphological change at scales commensurate with contemporary management and policy-making requirements: 1) The system being studied must be bounded with reference to the time and space scales at which behaviours of interest emerge and/or scientific or management problems arise; 2) model complexity and comprehensiveness must be appropriate to the problem at hand; 3) modellers should seek a priori insights into what kind of behaviours are likely to be evident at the scale of interest and the extent to which the behavioural validity of a model may be constrained by its underlying assumptions and its comprehensiveness; 4) informed by qualitative insights into likely dynamic behaviour, models should then be formulated with a view to resolving critical state changes; and 5) meso-scale modelling of coastal morphological change should reflect critically on the role of modelling and its relation to the observable world.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"3-16","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Coastalevolution","Complexity","Modelling","Systems theory"]},{"key":"UJW6LJAT","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"LynchAlfaro","lastName":" Jessica W."},{"firstName":"Boubli","lastName":" Jean P."},{"firstName":"Paim","lastName":" Fernanda P."},{"firstName":"Ribas","lastName":" Camila C."},{"firstName":"Silva","lastName":" Maria Nazareth F. da"},{"firstName":"Messias","lastName":" Mariluce R."},{"firstName":"Röhe","lastName":" Fabio"},{"firstName":"Mercês","lastName":" Michelle P."},{"firstName":"Silva Júnior","lastName":" José S."},{"firstName":"Silva","lastName":" Claudia R."},{"firstName":"Pinho","lastName":" Gabriela M."},{"firstName":"Koshkarian","lastName":" Gohar"},{"firstName":"Nguyen","lastName":" Mai T.

We use statistical phylogeographic methods to create a mitochondrial DNA-based timetree for 118 squirrel monkey samples across 68 localities spanning all Amazonian centers of endemism, with the aim of better understanding (1) the effects of rivers as barriers to dispersal and distribution; (2) the area of origin for modern Saimiri; (3) whether ancestral Saimiri was a lowland lake-affiliated or an upland forest taxa; and (4) the effects of Pleistocene climate fluctuation on speciation. We also use our topology to help resolve current controversies in Saimiri taxonomy and species relationships. The Rondônia and Inambari centers in the southern Amazon were recovered as the most likely areas of origin for Saimiri. The Amazon River proved a strong barrier to dispersal, and squirrel monkey expansion and diversification was rapid, with all speciation events estimated to occur between 1.4 and 0.6Ma, predating the last three glacial maxima and eliminating climate extremes as the main driver of squirrel monkey speciation. Saimiri expansion was concentrated first in central and western Amazonia, which according to the “Young Amazon” hypothesis was just becoming available as floodplain habitat with the draining of the Amazon Lake. Squirrel monkeys also expanded and diversified east, both north and south of the Amazon, coincident with the formation of new rivers. This evolutionary history is most consistent with a Young Amazon Flooded Forest Taxa model, suggesting Saimiri has always maintained a lowland wetlands niche and was able to greatly expand its range with the transition from a lacustrine to a riverine system in Amazonia. Saimiri vanzolinii was recovered as the sister group to one clade of Saimiri ustus, discordant with the traditional Gothic vs. Roman morphological division of squirrel monkeys. We also found paraphyly within each of the currently recognized species: S. sciureus, S. ustus, and S. macrodon. We discuss evidence for taxonomic revision within the genus Saimiri, and the need for future work using nuclear markers.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:26","pages":"436-454","language":"en","automatic_tags":["SouthAmerica","Phylogenetics","Cebidae","Pleistocene diversification","Refugia hypothesis","River barriers"]},{"key":"WX4YECLX","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Alamgir","lastName":"Mohammed"},{"firstName":"Turton","lastName":" Stephen M."},{"firstName":"Macgregor","lastName":" Colin J."},{"firstName":"Pert","lastName":" Petina L."}],"title":"Assessing regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in a contrasting tropical forest landscape","publication_title":"Ecological Indicators","issn":"1470-160X","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.01.016","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X16000200","abstract_note":"Ecosystem services are the bridge between nature and society, and are essential elements of community well-being. The Wet Tropics Australia, is environmentally and biologically diverse, and supplies numerous ecosystem services. It contributes to the community well-being of this region, Australian national economy and global climate change mitigation efforts. However, the ecosystem services in the region have rarely been assessed undermining strategic landscape planning to sustain their future flow. In this study, we attempted to: (i) assess the quantity of five regulating ecosystem services – global climate regulation, air quality regulation, erosion regulation, nutrient regulation, and cyclone protection, and three provisioning ecosystem services – habitat provision, energy provision and timber provision across rainforests, sclerophyll forests and rehabilitated plantation forests; (ii) evaluate the variation of supply of those regulating and provisioning ecosystem services across environmental gradients, such as rainfall, temperature, and elevation; (iii) show the relationships among those ecosystem services; and (iv) identify the hotspots of single and multiple ecosystem services supply across the landscape. The results showed that rainforests possess a very high capacity to supply single and multiple ecosystem services, and the hotspots for most of the regulating and provisioning ecosystem services are found in upland rainforest followed by lowland rainforest, and upland sclerophyll forest. Elevation, rainfall and temperature gradients along with forest structure are the main determinant factors for the quantity of ecosystem services supplied across the three forest types. The correlation among ecosystem services may be positive or negative depending on the ecosystem service category and vegetation type. The rehabilitated plantation forests may provide some ecosystem services comparable to the rainforest. The results demonstrated disturbance regimes (such as tropical cyclones) may have influenced the usual spatial trend of ecosystem service values. This study will assist decision makers in incorporating ecosystem services into their natural resource management planning, and for practitioners to identify the areas with higher values of specific and multiple ecosystem services.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"319-334","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Environmentalgradient","Global climate regulation","Rehabilitated plantation forest","Sclerophyll forest"]},{"key":"A3QYRI7C","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Marega-Imamura","lastName":"Marcela"},{"firstName":"Michalski","lastName":" Fernanda"},{"firstName":"Silva","lastName":" Kátia"},{"firstName":"Schiavetti","lastName":" Alexandre"},{"firstName":"Le Pendu","lastName":" Yvonnick"},{"firstName":"de Carvalho Oliveira","lastName":" Leonardo"}],"title":"Scientific collaboration networks in research on human threats to cetaceans in Brazil","publication_title":"Marine Policy","issn":"0308-597X","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103738","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X18305876","abstract_note":"To better understand the threats posed by human activities on cetaceans, we compiled published studies and determined where, how, and by whom the research on this subject has been conducted in Brazil.

However, human degradation and destruction of mangrove forests is common, despite and because of our reliance on them as valuable ecosystems.

To better understand the complex dynamics, interactions and relationships that exist between mangroves and coastal communities, the 5th Mangrove Macrobenthos and Management (MMM5) conference was held in Singapore in July 2019, with the theme “Mangroves and People: Impacts and Interactions”. This theme was chosen because Southeast Asia is the epicentre of ongoing mangrove loss, and a large number of coastal communities in the region rely on the ecosystem services that mangroves provide. The 32 papers published in this Special Issue represent the breadth of mangrove research presented at MMM5, including topics in faunal biology, ecosystem ecology, genetics, physical geography, biogeochemistry, remote sensing and the social sciences. The articles are characterized under the following topics: 1) mangrove ecosystem functioning; 2) range expansion of mangroves; 3) ecosystem services of mangroves; 4) anthropogenic and natural threats to mangroves; and 5) the management and social-ecology of mangroves. This Special Issue highlights the current state of the art of mangrove research and application, and describes a number of emerging new ideas and research opportunities that will continue to advance mangrove ecosystem science into the future.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"107155","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"RD7W5AHC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2013","author":[{"firstName":"Martinez","lastName":"Jean-Michel"},{"firstName":"Carretier","lastName":" Sébastien"},{"firstName":"Santos","lastName":" Roberto Ventura"}],"title":"The hydrology, geochemistry, and dynamics of South American great river systems","publication_title":"Journal of South American Earth Sciences","issn":"0895-9811","doi":"10.1016/j.jsames.2013.01.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981113000199","abstract_note":"Long term and high resolution data on water discharge, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and contaminant concentrations in rivers are required for a better understanding of particulate transfers from the continental areas to the seas. The aim of this study was to provide a novel estimation of annual fluxes of SPM and related pollutants in the Rhône River from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean Sea by combining high frequency or time-integrative monitoring and novel relations between SPM concentration (Cs) and water discharge (Q). At six stations of the Rhône Sediment Observatory (OSR), SPM fluxes were calculated over the 2000–2016 period by combining observational data and Cs-Q relations. Monthly average concentrations of mercury (Hg) and PCB 180 were obtained by analysis of SPM samples collected in time integrative particle traps between 2011 and 2016. These pollutants were selected because of the well documented contamination of the Rhône watershed by these substances. Inter-annual fluxes at the Rhône River outlet averaged 6.6 Mt. yr−1 for SPM, 572 kg yr−1 for Hg and 14 kg yr−1 for PCB 180. The Isère and Durance tributaries were found to be the main contributors of SPM fluxes. Annual SPM budgets were not balanced, suggesting deposition, remobilization of bottom sediments and/or contributions from non-monitored tributaries. The SPM sampled at the outlet was more contaminated than the combined SPM inputs from the monitored tributaries, suggesting that intermediate sources of contamination were not captured in the budget. We use first field-based observations of precipitation and river isotopic chemistry from a three-year study (2009–2011) in rainforest and nearby savannah in central Guyana at the northern rim of the Amazon rainforest to establish the quality of modelled or remotely-sensed datasets. Our 3 years of data capture a reduced rainfall regime in 2009 and an extended wet season in 2010, in contrast to the widely documented Amazonian floods in 2009 and droughts in 2010. Comparisons of observed precipitation with satellite derived TRMM and ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis precipitation show that both of these data sets capture the general pattern of seasonality, but substantially underestimate rainfall amounts in the primary wet season (by up to 50% and 72% respectively). The TRMM dataset is generally better at characterising the main dry season from September to December but the ERA-Interim model can overestimate precipitation in the dry season by up to 175%. Our new data on isotopic chemistry of river waters show that δ2H/δ18O values in this region are broadly consistent with interpolated global datasets of modelled precipitation isotopic signatures. The dominance of isotopically lighter water derived from the rains of the ITCZ during the wet season provides evidence of the close coupling of water chemistry of headwater rivers on the northern rim of Amazonia to the positioning of the ITCZ over the region. Our results highlight the challenge in understanding and representing local scale hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics using regional scale model data. We argue that combining point and local scale field data with larger scale model data is necessary to progress towards a comprehensive understanding of climate–hydrology interactions in Amazonia. This paper presents an evolutionary model for a coastal barrier in the southernmost coastal sector of Brazil during the Holocene. The dataset is based on 15–20 m drill cores and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) records. The model barrier evolution has two main steps. The first step is the transgression of the barrier controlled by sea-level rise during the Postglacial Marine Transgression, which ended at approximately 6–5 cal ka. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the coastal plain began to be flooded by lagoonal waters between ∼10 and 6.7 cal ka. The second step comprises a barrier transgression controlled by a negative sediment budget of the beach system during the last 6–5 cal ka in a period of an overall slow sea-level fall of approximately 2 m. During the second step, the transgressive barrier migrated because of coastal erosion (the negative sediment budget) and the landward transference of sand by wind and lagoonal delta washout. During fieldwork carried out in January 2009 at Aurora do Tocantins (Tocantins State, northern Brazil), we recovered a fragmentary right maxilla (UNIRIO-PM 1006) of Catagonus stenocephalus from a sedimentary deposit of presumed late Pleistocene age in a karstic cave. This paper aims to: (1) provide the first record of C. stenocephalus in the northern region of Brazil (and consequently, also the northernmost one); (2) update the geographic distribution of C. stenocephalus; (3) present a date for the specimen; and (4) discuss the palaeoenvironmental and palaeobiogeographical implications of the finding. The species C. stenocephalus (Lund) is known from the Bonaerian (middle Pleistocene) and Lujanian (late Pleistocene to earliest Holocene) ages in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia. The new record presented here extends the geographical distribution of C. stenocephalus more than 1000 km north from the former northernmost record (caves of Lagoa Santa region). Peccaries of the genus Catagonus have several morphological features associated with cursorial habits in relatively open and dry environments. The new distributional range of C. stenocephalus is coincident with the Chacoan subregion, characterized by dry climates and open areas. As the studied material comes from the top of the carbonate layer, this may suggest that the deposition of the C. stenocephalus remains described here is synchronous with the onset of a wetter climate phase. This argument is also in accordance with the datation results, around 20 ky BP, just after the last glacial maximum. This increasingly wet climate, which may also be related to the climatic changes that occurred during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene, could be a factor in the extinction of C. stenocephalus in South America. Two sediment cores from Mauritia flexuosa palm swamps have been studied by pollen and charcoal analysis. The cores Fazenda Cigana (FC) and Terra Indígena Aningal (TIA) were taken from a savanna-forest ecotone area in the Roraima State, northern Brazilian Amazon. Based on 5 radiocarbon dates, these records allow the reconstruction of the vegetation fire and climate dynamics during the past 1550 years. At the FC site was recorded a higher proportion of forest cover, suggesting local wetter climatic conditions favorable for forest expansion, especially by gallery forests, between 1550 and 1400 cal yr BP. Stands of M. flexuosa started to establish on the site indicating sufficient soil moisture. From 1400 to 1050 cal yr BP, forest cover retreated while savanna, and the Mauritia palm swamp expanded considerably. The FC site was marked by savanna and Mauritia cover with a slight increase of forest between ca. 1050 and 900 cal yr BP. From 900 to 300 cal yr BP the savanna and palm swamp taxa became dominant and the forest area decreased. At the TIA site the savanna cover was dominant between 1200 and 1000 cal yr BP. From 1000 to 700 forest expanded while savanna and Mauritia palm swamp reduced. Between 700 and 300 cal yr BP savanna and Mauritia palm swamp increased and forest area decreased. The high amount of charred particles found in the sediments, indicate fires with a marked increase between 1400 to 1000 cal yr BP (FC site) and 700 to 300 cal yr BP (TIA site), and probably caused the retreat of forest cover during these two time intervals. The relatively lower fire activity after 300 cal yr BP until present-day favored the increase of forested area at both TIA and FC sites. The arrival of the European settler and the subsequent introduction of cattle, is suggested as the main reason for the decrease of fire in the study region. The results point the fire caused by indigenous people as the principal controlling factor for forest and savanna dynamics during the past 1550 years. A metre-thick ultramafic lamprophyre dyke intrudes the basement of the Tandilia belt at the Sierra Alta de Vela, Argentina. A petrological and geochemical study of this rock and associated small dykes indicates a predominantly calc-alkaline trend. Phlogopite K–Ar dating of the ultramafic lamprophyre gave a minimum age of 1928 ± 54 Ma as a late event of the Transamazonian Orogeny, which is well represented in the basement of the Tandilia belt. An electron microprobe study indicates the presence of phlogopite, albite, chromite and Cr-rich phenocrysts and Cr-free microphenocrysts of diopside as primary minerals. Subsequent to deformation at the contacts with the wall rock, metasomatism generated strongly zoned amphibole (edenite, pargasite, Mg-hastingite and tremolite compositions) and andradite as well as chlorite, sericite, albite, apatite and calcite. The central zone of the lamprophyre is almost undeformed and exhibits some ocellar texture. Geochemical and isotopic signatures of the lamprophyre suggest that its magma source may have previously undergone incompatible element enrichment of the mantle source, representing the original precursor magma for the calc-alkaline dyke series of the Sierra Alta de Vela. A new middle Miocene vertebrate fauna from Peruvian Amazonia is described. It yields the marsupials Sipalocyon sp. (Hathliacynidae) and Marmosa (Micoureus) cf. laventica (Didelphidae), as well as an unidentified glyptodontine xenarthran and the rodents Guiomys sp. (Caviidae), “Scleromys” sp., cf. quadrangulatus-schurmanni-colombianus (Dinomyidae), an unidentified acaremyid, and cf. Microsteiromys sp. (Erethizontidae). Apatite Fission Track provides a detrital age (17.1 ± 2.4 Ma) for the locality, slightly older than its inferred biochronological age (Colloncuran-early Laventan South American Land Mammal Ages: ∼15.6–13.0 Ma). Put together, both the mammalian assemblage and lithology of the fossil-bearing level point to a mixture of tropical rainforest environment and more open habitats under a monsoonal-like tropical climate. The fully fluvial origin of the concerned sedimentary sequence suggests that the Amazonian Madre de Dios Subandean Zone was not part of the Pebas mega-wetland System by middle Miocene times. This new assemblage seems to reveal a previously undocumented “spatiotemporal transition” between the late early Miocene assemblages from high latitudes (Patagonia and Southern Chile) and the late middle Miocene faunas of low latitudes (Colombia, Perú, Venezuela, and ?Brazil). Particulate suspended matter concentration (SPM) were estimated over a 8 year time period (2002–2010) in the coastal waters of French Guiana from a regional algorithm applied to the MODIS monthly reflectance measurements. Comparison between SPOT images and MODIS-SPM maps revealed the strong spatio-temporal coupling between in water SPM and the dynamics of local (i.e. Kourou and Cayenne) mud banks. Highest MODIS SPM values (>13 g m−3 approximately) can be significantly associated with the subtidal part of the banks as well as to the related turbid plume. The migration of these mud banks induces strong interannual changes in SPM reaching up to 6% year−1 within increasing and decreasing patchy areas distributed alternatively along the coastline of French Guiana. Mud banks migration rates derived from MODIS SPM data reach in average about 2 km year−1 in agreement with previous studies. The MODIS time series have allowed for a detailed description of the seasonality and interannual variations in the in-water SPM loads. Seasonal changes in SPM are related to the onset of the trade wind season. Marked non-linear patterns including a sharp evolution in the SPM values around 2005 as well as additional high frequency modulations have been emphasized within the upward and downward SPM trend regions. Concurrent temporal variations in the frequency of northward swells (favoring mud banks migration and reworking) as well as interannual changes in the amount of sediment delivered by the Amazon River have been shown to play a major role in the SPM temporal patterns observed in the French Guiana coastal waters. Our results clearly demonstrate the advantage for ocean color data to describe mud banks dynamics through the assessment of in water SPM temporal variability.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"1-3","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"ZMJ64TDS","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2013","author":[{"firstName":"Fearnside","lastName":"Philip M."}],"title":"South American Natural Ecosystems, Status of","publication_title":"Encyclopedia of Biodiversity (Second Edition)","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012384719500246X","abstract_note":"The term ecoregion, as used in this article, refers to “natural” ecological systems, or terrestrial and aquatic areas as they were when Europeans first arrived in the New World.

The transition of natural forest and savannah ecosystems to pastureland and agricultural crops is predicted to create warmer and drier atmospheric conditions than the native vegetation. Using a coupled ecosystem regional atmospheric model (EDBRAMS) we investigate the expected impacts of predicted future land use on the climate of South America. The climate response in the model simulations is generally consistent with expectations from previous global modeling simulations with drier conditions resulting from deforestation, however the changes in precipitation are relatively small (on order of a few percent). Local drying is driven primarily by decreases in evapo-transpiration associated with the loss of forest, and concomitant increases in runoff. Significant changes in convectively available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN) during the transition to the wet season indicate that the decrease in surface latent heat flux is indeed leading to a drier atmosphere, however these changes occur around a mean climatological state that is already very favorable for convection, and thus lead to relatively small changes in precipitation. If, however, these land use changes were to occur under a background state of drier conditions, such as those predicted for the future global climate model experiments, this additional atmospheric drying may be sufficient to decrease precipitation more substantially.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"12-24","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazondeforestation","Biosphere–atmosphere interactions","Ecosystem–climate interactions"]},{"key":"MGU98HEA","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Skoulikidis","lastName":"Nikolaos Th."}],"title":"Chapter 1 - Mountainous areas and river systems","publication_title":"Environmental Water Requirements in Mountainous Areas","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128193426000099","abstract_note":"Mountains and mountain rivers provide a multitude of invaluable goods and services to a profound portion of the planet’s population.

In the context of jellyfish proliferation in many overexploited marine ecosystems studying the spatio-temporal foraging patterns of the giant “jellyvore” leatherback turtle turns out to be particularly relevant. Here we analyzed long-term tracking data to assess spatio-temporal foraging patterns in 21 leatherback turtles during their pluri-annual migration in the Northern Atlantic. Through an analytical approach based on the animal's own motion (independent of currents) and diving behavior distinct zones of high and low foraging success were identified. High foraging success occurred in a sub-equatorial zone spanning the width of the Atlantic and at high (>30°N) latitudes. Between these zones in the centre of North Atlantic gyre there was low foraging success. This “ocean desert” area was traversed at high speed by leatherbacks on their way to more productive areas at higher latitudes. Animals traveled slowly in high foraging success areas and dived shallower (17.2±8.0kmday−1 and 53.6±33.1m mean±SD respectively) than in low foraging success areas (51.0±13.1kmday−1 and 81.8±56.2m mean±SD respectively). These spatio-temporal foraging patterns seem to relatively closely match the main features of the integrated meso-zooplankton distribution in the North Atlantic. Our method of defining high foraging success areas is intuitive and relatively easy to implement but also takes into account the impact of oceanic currents on animal's behavior.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"225-234","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Divingpattern","Foraging behavior","Leatherback turtle","Migration strategy","North Atlantic Ocean","Zooplankton distribution"]},{"key":"Z35EFJJI","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2013","author":[{"firstName":"Niles","lastName":"Keron"},{"firstName":"Lloyd","lastName":" Bob"}],"title":"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) & energy aid: Impacts on the energy sector in the Caribbean and Pacific","publication_title":"Energy for Sustainable Development","issn":"0973-0826","doi":"10.1016/j.esd.2013.07.004","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0973082613000653","abstract_note":"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean and Pacific have gone from a place of self-sufficiency and energy independence, during pre-colonial times, to a position, in more recent times, of being (often heavily) dependent on both imported capital (loans and aid) and imported sources of energy. This paper asserts that the current dependence of Caribbean and Pacific SIDS on both development assistance from donor agencies and imported fossil fuels is not coincidental, but rather, it was due to the transition of these islands from subsistence agriculture to export-oriented economies, primarily to serve the interests of more developed metropolitan countries. These interests have included the provision of cheap raw materials and agricultural produce to imperial nations; which has meant that SIDS needed to develop export orientated economies requiring both financial capital and energy supply usually over and above that available locally. The impact of colonisation on domestic energy use and demand in SIDS is thus briefly outlined so as to make clear how these nations transitioned from self-sufficiency to dependence on foreign capital and energy. It is upon this backdrop that the current dependence of SIDS on international aid, particularly with regards to the energy sector, has been analysed, along with its influence on energy policy in SIDS. This paper suggests that while imported finance and energy have been crucial to the past development of SIDS, the extent of reliance upon external financial assistance and energy imports at present is a cause for concern not only due to long term energy security issues but also because of the climate change implications of fossil fuel use. The concern is also pressing within the context of long term debt accumulation. It is argued herein that closer attention should be paid to local capacity building, training and institutional strengthening to enable a transition to renewable energy in place of fossil fuel based power. In terms of long term resilience such capacity building could eventually include the means for the production of renewable energy technology components.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"521-530","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Caribbean","Aid","Dependence","Energy","Islands","Pacific"]},{"key":"ALQ7KW69","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"1999","author":[{"firstName":"He","lastName":"Shunping"},{"firstName":"Gayet","lastName":" Mireille"},{"firstName":"Meunier","lastName":" François J."}],"title":"Phylogeny of the Amphiliidae (Teleostei: Siluriformes)","publication_title":"Annales des Sciences Naturelles - Zoologie et Biologie Animale","issn":"0003-4339","doi":"10.1016/S0003-4339(00)88881-4","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003433900888814","abstract_note":"The freshwater African catfish family Amphiliidae had been reviewed based on the 73 osteological characters with Diplomystidae, † Hypsidoridae, Amblycipitidae, Sisoridae, and Bagridae as out-groups.

This paper takes up the case of the “MAP Initiative”, a transboundary network in the tri-national frontier of the southwestern Amazon that sought to support EG. We examine three key questions: 1) how do transboundary networks motivate participants to engage in collaboration across boundaries for EG, 2) how do transboundary networks evolve structurally as well as strategically to increase their impact on EG, and 3) can transboundary networks generate outcomes beyond information sharing for EG? The analysis draws on historical documents, participant observation, and key informant interviews about the MAP Initiative. The findings confirm that transboundary networks motivate cross-border exchanges in multiple ways, they evolve structurally in multiple ways that increase their capacity, and that evolution supports multiple forms of activities and outcomes that support EG.

This preliminary study aims at determining how heavy metals are distributed in mangrove sediments and pore-waters in relationship with their organic content. To reach our goal, a series of 50-cm deep cores were collected in the mangrove of Conception Bay. The various coring sites are representative of live forests (Avicennia marina, Rhizophora stylosa), dead forest, and intertidal unvegetated area. The ranges of concentrations in sediments were the following (μmolg−1): Cu (0.08 to 0.51), Co (0.01 to 0.38), Ni (0.03 to 3.55), Cr (0.36 to 3.11), Zn (0.68 to 2.36), Mn (1.13 to 5.0) and Fe (22.64 to 721.69). Heavy metals distribution within sediments and pore-water appear to result from diagenetic processes linked to OM decomposition. Beneath the dead Avicennia forest and in the unvegetated sediments, the higher the organic content, the higher the metal concentration in the solid phase. Beneath living mangrove stands, despite a higher organic content, as well as higher sulphur content, heavy metals concentrations were not higher than those measured in the other sampling sites. Beneath these forests, redox conditions were mainly controlled by the length of waterlogging and the activity of root system. We suggest that, because of the specificity of the Avicennia root system and its position in the intertidal zone, heavy metals are more bioavailable and potentially more mobile than beneath Rhizophora stand.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"444-456","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mangrove","Heavy metals","New Caledonia","Organic matter","Redox conditions"]},{"key":"NKZ4CGXT","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Vinh","lastName":"Truong Van"},{"firstName":"Marchand","lastName":" Cyril"},{"firstName":"Linh","lastName":" Tran Vu Khanh"},{"firstName":"Vinh","lastName":" Duong Dang"},{"firstName":"Allenbach","lastName":" Michel"}],"title":"Allometric models to estimate above-ground biomass and carbon stocks in Rhizophora apiculata tropical managed mangrove forests (Southern Viet Nam)","publication_title":"Forest Ecology and Management","issn":"0378-1127","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2018.12.017","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112718311551","abstract_note":"Mangrove forests can fix and store high quantities of carbon both in their soil and in their biomass, the latter peaking in the equatorial regions and decreasing with latitude. In Vietnam, more than 80% of the mangroves develop either in the Mekong Delta or in the Can Gio Estuary, which are characterized by tropical monsoon climates. Most of these mangroves were planted and are dominated by Rhizophora apiculata Blume. The main objectives of this study were to determine forest structure, above-ground biomass and carbon conversion factors for each tree component in order to obtain allometric equations and to derive carbon stocks for managed Rhizophora stands of different ages developing within this context. Thirty-six trees, having a diameter at breast height (DBH) ranging from 7.0 to 36.2 cm, from a planted mangrove forest were harvested in Ca Mau (Mekong Delta) to determine allometric equations. In addition, thirteen plots were established in both Ca Mau and Can Gio mangrove forests, to determine above-ground carbon densities. We proposed the following specific allometric equation to estimate total above-ground biomass (kg) for managed R. apiculata mangrove stands in Southern Vietnam: WTotal = 0.38363 * DBH2.2348 (R2 = 0.976, SE = 1.17, F = 1401, P < 0.001). The total above-ground biomass ranged from 135.4 to 523.6 Mg ha−1 depending on forest age and tree density. Consequently, and taking into account a carbon conversion factor of 44.09%, carbon stocks in the above-ground biomass of R. apiculata mangrove forests in Southern Vietnam ranged from 59.7 to 230.9 Mg C ha−1. The mean carbon partitioning in the tree biomass was: 77.11% for trunks, 11.87% for branches, 8.66% for prop roots, and 2.36% for leaves. However, this distribution, as well as annual height increments and biomass increase rates, also varied with forest age and tree densities. We suggested that tree density reduction through thinning activities allowed easier tree development, resulting in an increased biomass with enhanced allocation to branches and above-ground prop roots for the stability of the trees. Using the specific allometric equation and specific carbon conversion factor reduced the uncertainty in the estimation of above-ground biomass and carbon stocks.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"131-141","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"IGH9W85N","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Towsey","lastName":"Michael"},{"firstName":"Parsons","lastName":" Stuart"},{"firstName":"Sueur","lastName":" Jérôme"}],"title":"Ecology and acoustics at a large scale","publication_title":"Ecological Informatics","issn":"1574-9541","doi":"10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.02.002","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954114000181","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"1-3","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"LB9S6CMQ","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Ayarza","lastName":"Miguel"},{"firstName":"Rao","lastName":" Idupulapati"},{"firstName":"Vilela","lastName":" Lourival"},{"firstName":"Lascano","lastName":" Carlos"},{"firstName":"Vera-Infanzón","lastName":" Raul"}],"title":"Chapter Three - Soil carbon accumulation in crop-livestock systems in acid soil savannas of South America: A review","publication_title":"Advances in Agronomy","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S006521132200030X","abstract_note":"Acid soil savannas of tropical America are a vast resource to expand agricultural production, alleviate the pressure on tropical rainforest and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. During the past three decades there have been major changes in land use in the Cerrados of Brazil and to a lesser extent in the Llanos of Colombia. Monocropping and improved pasture grasses were adopted widely to boost crop and animal production. Various types of integrated crop-livestock systems and no-till cropping systems were introduced to not only recuperate degraded pastures but also to sustain crop and livestock productivity. Several studies showed that well-managed pastures based on deep rooted tropical forage grass and legume species could accumulate significant amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) in deeper soil layers. Among the number of factors that influence SOC accumulation, deep rooting ability of grasses and high root turnover seem to play a major role in accumulation of SOC in deeper soil layers in the form of particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral associated organic carbon (MAOC). This review provides insights toward some key approaches and management options to increase both POC and MAOC accumulation and particularly MAOC accumulation in deeper soil layers in crop-livestock systems. There are some important gaps in our knowledge, particularly regarding the influence of length of pasture phase on MAOC accumulation in deeper soil layers from crop-livestock systems.

This apparent lack of a clear phylogenetic thread has created difficulties both in linking isoprenoid function with evolution and for the development of accurate biosphere-atmosphere models. Here, we present a systematic emission study of “hyperdominant” tree species in the Amazon Basin. Across 162 individuals, distributed among 25 botanical families and 113 species, isoprenoid emissions were widespread among both early and late successional species (isoprene: 61.9% of the species; monoterpenes: 15.0%; both isoprene and monoterpenes: 9.7%). The hyperdominant species (69) across the top five most abundant genera, which make up about 50% of all individuals in the Basin, had a similar abundance of isoprenoid emitters (isoprene: 63.8%; monoterpenes: 17.4%; both 11.6%). Among the abundant genera, only Pouteria had a low frequency of isoprene emitting species (15.8% of 19 species). In contrast, Protium, Licania, Inga, and Eschweilera were rich in isoprene emitting species (83.3% of 12 species, 61.1% of 18 species, 100% of 8 species, and 100% of 12 species, respectively). Light response curves of individuals in each of the five genera showed light-dependent, photosynthesis-linked emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes. Importantly, in every genus, we observed species with light-dependent isoprene emissions together with monoterpenes including β-ocimene. These observations support the emerging view of the evolution of isoprene synthases from β-ocimene synthases. Our results have important implications for understanding isoprenoid function-evolution relationships and the development of more accurate Earth System Models.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"112366","language":"en","automatic_tags":["And isoprene and monoterpene emissions in the amazon rainforest","Isoprene synthase","Mycene/ocimene synthase"]},{"key":"2YQISZ6J","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Hdom","lastName":"Hélde A.

Using ARDL approach, the empirical findings provide evidence of the cross-sectional dependence in the data and existence of cointegration. The pollution has a relationship with economic growth, and the fossil electricity in short-run. The estimations strongly reveal that renewable energy has a negative effect on CO2 emissions in long run. Also, in the long-run, fossil electricity has shown results become statistically insignificant. However, the adjustment mechanism corrected the model by around 27% in the following period. In this way, the electricity production at aggregate level is used a factor environmental pressure and as an indicator of economic activity in South America countries, where the renewable energy with an increasing long-run effect, remains an efficient substitute for the fossil-electricity. Thus, we recommend to the countries of South America that they maintain the long-term efforts to produce electricity from renewable sources.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"186-197","language":"en","automatic_tags":["SouthAmerica","ARDL","CO2 emissions","Economic growth","Fossil & RE electricity"]},{"key":"SE5DL2EH","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Macario","lastName":"Phoeve"},{"firstName":"Toledo-Lima","lastName":" Guilherme Santos"},{"firstName":"Tavares-Damasceno","lastName":" João Paulo"},{"firstName":"Pichorim","lastName":" Mauro"}],"title":"Avian response to prolonged drought in drylands: The case of two dove species in Brazil's semi-arid region","publication_title":"Journal of Arid Environments","issn":"0140-1963","doi":"10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.104447","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140196321000136","abstract_note":"In view of the scenario of global warming, understanding how individuals disperse and populations fluctuate in response to climatic extremes is becoming increasingly important.

We used Huggins closed population models to estimate detection rates and population size.

We also observed that the prolonged drought has negatively impacted on doves density. The recovery of banded individuals at other sites indicates that nomadism may be the principal strategy adopted by doves to endure periods of drought.

In this paper, we first argue that these new boundaries can be endogenously exhibited with the mathematical concepts of viability kernel and viable controls. Second, it is shown how these no whinge kernels have components, such as harvesting of resources, that should remain within safe corridor while some other components, in particular biodiversity, have only lower conservation limits. Thus, using radar charts, we show how this no whinge kernels can take the shape of a tree that we name viability tree. These trees of viability capture the idea that the unbounded renewal potential of biodiversity combined with a bounded use of the different ecosystem services are crucial ingredients for the sustainability of socio-ecosystems and the design of no whinge policies reconciling the different stakeholders involved.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"183-188","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Sustainability","Modeling","Scenarios","Ecological economics","Minimal whinge","Safe operating space","Viability kernel"]},{"key":"99I3VE29","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2009","author":[{"firstName":"Wong","lastName":"Th.

BHP Billiton Maatschappij Suriname. The Coropina Formation consists of the Para and Lelydorp Members. We present a detailed lithological subdivision of these members. In the Para Member, four units are discerned which are grouped in two transgressive cycles, both ranging upward from terrestrial towards chenier and coastal mudflat deposits reflecting glacio-eustatic sea-level changes. The sandy sediments represent fluviatile and beach-bar (chenier) deposits, and were supplied by rivers from the Precambrian basement and to a lesser extent by westward longshore coastal drift. Clays, largely derived from the Amazon River and transported alongshore over the shelf, were deposited in extensive coastal mudflats. The Lelydorp Member, also comprising four units, represents a depositional system that is closely comparable to the recent Suriname coastal setting, i.e., a lateral and vertical alternation of mudflat and chenier deposits formed over a period characterised by more or less constant sea level. Palaeomagnetic data indicate a dominantly reversed magnetic polarity in the Para Member, whereas the Lelydorp Member shows a normal magnetic polarity with a minor reversed polarity overprint. The reversed polarities of the Para Member exclude a Brunhes Chron (0.78–0.0 Ma) age, and thus assign it to the Matuyama Chron (2.58–0.78 Ma).

Long-lasting and high-intensity deforestation, low coverage of protected areas, and high level of species endemism make the Belém Endemism Area (BEA) particularly more vulnerable than the rest of the Amazon area. However, this occurrence remains strongly neglected in global and regional conservation analyses. In this study, we used species distribution modeling and remote sensing data to map the richness pattern of endangered birds from the Amazon and assessed the species' conservation status based on landscape patterns of forest remnants. Our results revealed that the BEA's imperiled avifauna presents the most significant state of vulnerability to extinction compared with other areas of endemism in the Amazon. Almost 80 % of the total area of the BEA presents a strong anthropization of natural ecosystems. Of the 20 % of the area with high conservation value remnants, only 25 % is within protected areas, whereas the other 75 % is under private property domains. Moreover, forest remnants on private properties have a higher biodiversity conservation value as they are home to more threatened bird species than remnants within protected areas. Therefore, we argue that effective implementation of conservation of threatened bird species in the BEA depends directly on the maintenance of forest remnants on private properties from practical conservation actions.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"125984","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Deforestation","Amazon forest","Biodiversity conservation","Species distribution modeling"]},{"key":"A9GS2W8K","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"LynchAlfaro","lastName":" Jessica W."},{"firstName":"Cortés-Ortiz","lastName":" Liliana"},{"firstName":"Di Fiore","lastName":" Anthony"},{"firstName":"Boubli","lastName":" Jean P."}],"title":"Special issue: Comparative biogeography of Neotropical primates","publication_title":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","issn":"1055-7903","doi":"10.1016/j.ympev.2014.09.027","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790314003492","abstract_note":"New research presented in this special issue of Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution on the “Phylogeny and Biogeography of Neotropical Primates” greatly improves our understanding of the evolutionary history of the New World monkeys and provides insights into the multiple platyrrhine radiations, diversifications, extinctions, and recolonizations that have taken place over time and over space in the Neotropics.

We also consider the role of the Amazon River and its major tributaries in shaping platyrrhine biodiversity, and how and when primates from the Amazon reached the Atlantic Forest. A key focus is on primate colonizations and extirpations in Central America, the Andes, and the seasonally dry tropical forests and savannas (such as the Llanos, Caatinga, and Cerrado habitats), all ecosystems that have been understudied up until now for primates. We suggest that most primates currently inhabiting drier open habitats are relatively recent arrivals, having expanded from rainforest habitats in the Pleistocene.

Medical milestones such as the discovery of mosquitoes as vectors and subsequently an effective vaccine significantly reduced its incidence, in spite of which, thousands of cases of this deathly disease still occur regularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Amazonian basin in South America, which are usually not reported. An urban outbreak in Angola, consecutive years of increasing incidence near major Brazilian cities, and imported cases in China, South America and Europe, have brought this virus back to the global spotlight. The aim of this article is to underline that the preventive YFV measures, such as vaccination, need to be carefully revised in order to minimize the risks of new YFV outbreaks, especially in urban or immunologically vulnerable places. Furthermore, this article highlights the diverse factors that have favored the spread of other Aedes spp.-associated arboviral diseases like Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika, to northern latitudes causing epidemics in the United States and Europe, emphasizing the possibility that YFV might follow the path of these viruses unless enhanced surveillance and efficient control systems are urgently initiated.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"143-150","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Arboviruses","Flavivirus","Prevention","Vaccination","Yellow fever virus"]},{"key":"HJV33673","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"1990","author":[{"firstName":"Gable","lastName":"Frank J."},{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":" David G."}],"title":"Potential impacts of contemporary changing climate on Caribbean coastlines","publication_title":"Ocean and Shoreline Management","issn":"0951-8312","doi":"10.1016/0951-8312(90)90012-7","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0951831290900127","abstract_note":"The threat of man-induced global change on the nations of the wider Caribbean region varies from place to place because of differences in exposure to storms, differences in local tectonics and subsidence, and variations in land-use practices.

These comparisons will form the basis for local response strategies; the common elements between nations provide a basis for responses similar to those other nations, whereas the differences mandate local adaptation. That the Caribbean will be impacted by climate change is certain: its environment, land uses, and economies are dictated in large part by this marine influence. Accompanying global change will be changes in sea level, differences in storm climate, and altered precipitation patterns; science cannot define today what form these changes will take.

The accompanied loss of ecosystem values, amongst which safety against flooding, has far reaching consequences for coastal communities, exacerbated by sea-level rise. To halt erosion various nature-based solutions have been implemented as an alternative to hard infrastructure sea defenses, including mangrove planting and erection of low-tech structures such as bamboo fences, permeable brushwood dams, etc. These structures have been designed on the basis of best-engineering practice, lacking sufficient scientific background. This paper investigates the use and success of permeable dams over a period of about 15 years, describing their application in Guyana, Indonesia, Suriname, Thailand and Vietnam, summarizing the lessons-learned, and analyzing their functioning in relation to the physical-biological coastal system. Also an overview of relevant costs is given. The basic philosophy behind the construction of permeable dams is the rehabilitation of mangrove habitat through re-establishment of the (fine) sediment dynamics – we refer to Building with Nature as the overarching principle of this approach. Our main conclusions are that a successful functioning of permeable dams requires (1) a thorough understanding of the physical-biological system and analysis of the relevant processes, (2) patience and persistence, including maintenance, as the natural time scales to rehabilitate mangrove green belts take years to decades, and (3) intensive stakeholder involvement. We give a list of conditions under which permeable dams may be successful, but in qualitative terms, as local site conditions largely govern their success or failure.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"106078","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Bamboofence","Building with Nature","Chenier","Coastal erosion","Ecological mangrove restoration","Mangrove-mud coast","Mud streaming","Nature-based solutions","Permeable dam"]},{"key":"PBW8CGHH","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Hanf","lastName":"Matthieu"},{"firstName":"Guégan","lastName":" Jean-François"},{"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":" Ismail"},{"firstName":"Nacher","lastName":" Mathieu"}],"title":"Disentangling the complexity of infectious diseases: Time is ripe to improve the first-line statistical toolbox for epidemiologists","publication_title":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","issn":"1567-1348","doi":"10.1016/j.meegid.2013.09.006","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813003444","abstract_note":"Because many biological processes related to the dynamics of infectious diseases are caused by complex interactions between the environment, the host(s) and the agent(s), the necessity to address the methodological implications of this inherent complexity has recently emerged in epidemiology. Most epidemiologists now acknowledge that most human infectious diseases are likely to have complex dynamics. However, this knowledge still percolates with difficulty in their statistical “modus operandi”. Indeed, for the study of complex systems, the traditional first-line statistical toolbox of epidemiologists (mainly built around the Generalized Linear Model family), despite its undeniable practicality and robustness, has structural limitations deprecating its usefulness. Three major sources of complexity neglected or not taken into account by this first-line statistical toolbox and having deep statistical implications are the multi-level organization of data, the non-linear relationships between variables and the complex interactions between variables. Three promising candidates to incorporate along with traditional tools for a new first-line statistical toolbox more suitable to apprehend these sources of complexity are the generalized linear mixed models, the generalized additive models, and the structural equation models. The aforementioned methodologies have the advantage to be generalizations of GLM models and are relatively easy to implement. Their assimilation and implementation would thus be greatly facilitated for epidemiologists. More globally, this text underlines that an improved use of other methods as such described here compared to traditional ones has to be performed to better understand the complexity challenging epidemiologists every day. This is particularly true in the field of infectious diseases for which major public health challenges will have to be addressed in the coming decades.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"497-505","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Infectiousdiseases","Complexity","Interactions","Multi-level organization","Nonlinearity","Statistics"]},{"key":"GL6AV9ZJ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2007","author":[{"firstName":"Houghton","lastName":"J.

Yet when compared to other abiotic variables affecting clutch success, rainfall has received relatively little attention. We therefore examined how fluctuations in local rainfall at a tropical nesting site for leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) affected the nest environment. Temperature data loggers placed within clutches (n=8) revealed that protracted rainfall had a marked cooling effect on nests, so that seasonally improbable male-producing temperatures (<29.75 °C) were produced. We use these data to explore how rainfall may ultimately influence the sex ratios of sea turtle hatchlings both within and between nesting seasons, and discuss the importance of robust estimates of rainfall for future demographic models.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"71-77","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Caribbean","Reptile","Precipitation","Sand temperature","Sex ratio"]},{"key":"YXFW2K6L","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2012","author":[{"firstName":"Renard","lastName":"D."},{"firstName":"Iriarte","lastName":" J."},{"firstName":"Birk","lastName":" J.

Archaeology offers examples of prehistoric pathways to agricultural intensification that could be rich sources of inspiration for applying ecological engineering in agriculture today. We examine one set of techniques, pre-Columbian raised-field agriculture in wetlands of Mesoamerica and South America. We point to gaps in knowledge at three levels. First, raised-field agriculture was conducted in a wide range of soils and climates. How different systems functioned was likely to have been correspondingly diverse, but this variation is under-appreciated. At the scale of single farms, nutrient dynamics in raised-field systems likely included complexities quite unusual in ‘modern’ agriculture, owing to the mixture of aerobic and waterlogged compartments, but data are scarce. Second, at the landscape level there is disagreement about whether fallow periods were necessary, and their eventual roles are poorly understood. Current evidence suggests that self-organizing processes in fallows may have increased the sustainability of some raised-field farming systems in unusual ways. Third, the labor-intensive nature of raised-field farming is held to limit its pertinence to today's global problems, but its real labor costs are unknown. Furthermore, achieving sustainable intensive agriculture will require compensating farmers for ecosystem services they provide. Under a socioeconomic regime that does this, raised-field agriculture could have considerable practical application.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"30-44","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Neotropicalregion","Rehabilitation","Wetlands","Ecologically intensive agriculture","Ecosystem engineers","Raised-field agriculture"]},{"key":"LDN2P98R","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Qingliang"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":" Zhongyan"},{"firstName":"Shangguan","lastName":" Wei"},{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":" Xuezhi"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":" Lu"},{"firstName":"Yu","lastName":" Fanhua"}],"title":"Improving soil moisture prediction using a novel encoder-decoder model with residual learning","publication_title":"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","issn":"0168-1699","doi":"10.1016/j.compag.2022.106816","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169922001338","abstract_note":"The skillful prediction of soil moisture can provide much help for many practical applications including ecosystem management and precision agriculture.

This model includes two layers: the encoder-decoder LSTM layer and LSTM with a fully connected layer, which is used to enhance the prediction ability by considering the intermediate time-series data between the input time step and the predictive time step. We tested EDT-LSTM for soil moisture prediction at the lead time of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days by using data from FLUXNET sites.

Previous work on the effects of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity have concentrated on taxonomic diversity. However, the effects of disturbances such as logging on the functional composition of communities (and thereby, ecosystem function) are poorly understood. Here, we examined variation in the functional traits and assembly processes of tropical montane rain forest communities along a gradient of logging intensity (clear-cut, selective logging, and old-growth) at three spatial scales (100 m2, 400 m2, and 2500 m2) in China. We measured six functional traits of species, including specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf chlorophyll (LChl), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf phosphorus content (LPC), and wood density (WD) in each forest plot. Functional composition changed along the disturbance gradient from logged to old-growth forests. Species with resource-acquisitive strategies (high SLA, LNC, and LPC) dominated the clear-cut forest. In contrast, species with resource-conservative strategies (high LDMC, LChl, and WD) dominated the old-growth forest, while species in the selectively-logged forest showed intermediate values. Across forests with different logging intensities, environmental filtering appeared to be the key process governing community assembly. Spatial scale had a significant effect on functional diversity and community assemblage but did not affect functional traits at the community level. At larger spatial scales, the functional richness and functional dispersion of the three forest types all increased and different community assembly processes were more obvious. Logged forests still need more time to recover levels of functional diversity observed in old-growth forest. Selective logging maintained more functional diversity than clear-cutting in these tropical montane rain forests.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"311-318","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Selectivelogging","Functional composition","Clear-cut","Community assembly","Forest recovery","Functional diversity","Spatial scale"]},{"key":"X8GIVIWD","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Hong"}],"title":"Are species lists derived from modeled species range maps appropriate for macroecological studies?

Here I evaluate whether it is appropriate to use species lists derived from modeled range maps in macroecological studies. I compared species lists derived from about 90,000 range maps in the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN) for over 180 geographic regions (12 broad regions covering the whole of the New World; 172 smaller regions, i.e. Taxonomic Databases Working Group units) with those representing complete or nearly complete species lists obtained from the literature for the regions. I determined the completeness of native species composition and proportion of false presences and exotic (non-native) species in species lists derived from range maps in BIEN. I determined whether errors in species lists derived from modeled range maps affect macroecological inferences by comparing the relationships of α- and β-diversity with geographic and climatic variables between different datasets (i.e. species lists derived from range maps versus complete or nearly complete species lists derived from the literature). The completeness for native species lists derived from range maps was 60–74%, depending on spatial scale. On average, 65% of the species in a species list derived from BIEN for a geographic area are false presences or non-native species to the area. The relationships of α- and β-diversity derived from the BIEN dataset with geographic and climatic variables differ significantly from those derived from complete species lists. This study shows that the results of a macroecological study based on species lists derived from modeled range maps may be substantially incorrect due to high percentages of missing native species, and high numbers of non-native species and false presences. Thus, it may not be appropriate to use species lists derived from modeled range maps in the macroecological studies that require complete or nearly complete species lists.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"146-156","language":"en","automatic_tags":["BIEN","Data quality","Modeled range map","Species checklist","Species distribution model","Vascular plants","α-diversity","β-diversity"]},{"key":"RIJ5E4SN","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Sist","lastName":"Plinio"},{"firstName":"Piponiot","lastName":" Camille"},{"firstName":"Kanashiro","lastName":" Milton"},{"firstName":"Pena-Claros","lastName":" Marielos"},{"firstName":"Putz","lastName":" Francis E."},{"firstName":"Schulze","lastName":" Mark"},{"firstName":"Verissimo","lastName":" Adalberto"},{"firstName":"Vidal","lastName":" Edson"}],"title":"Sustainability of Brazilian forest concessions","publication_title":"Forest Ecology and Management","issn":"0378-1127","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119440","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112721005296","abstract_note":"In 2006, the Brazilian Forest Service (SFB) started an ambitious program to establish forest concessions so as to provide a legal framework for long-term sustainable timber production in Amazonian forests. Forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon currently cover only 1.6 million ha (Mha) but we estimate the area of all potential concessions as 35 Mha. This paper assessed the conditions under which the present and potential concession system can ensure an annual production of 11 Mm3. yr−1 to meet the estimated present timber demand. For this we used the volume dynamics with differential equations model (VDDE) calibrated for the Amazon Basin with a Bayesian framework with data from 3500 ha of forest plots monitored for as long as 30 years after selective logging. Predictions of commercial volume recovery rates vary with location. We tested 27 different scenarios by using combinations of initial proportion of commercial volume, logging intensity and cutting cycle length. These scenarios were then applied to the current area of concessions and to the area of all potential concessions (35 Mha). Under current logging regulations and the current concession area (mean logging intensity of 15–20 m3.ha−1, a harvest cycle of 35 years and an initial commercial timber volume proportion of 20%), timber production can be maintained only for a single cutting cycle (35 years). Only the scenario with a logging intensity of 10 m3ha−1 every 60 years with a 90% initial proportion of commercial timber species can be considered as sustainable. Under this scenario, the maximum annual production with the present concession areas is 159,000 m3 (157–159), or less than 2% of the present annual production of 11 Mm3. When considering all potential concession areas (35 Mha), under current rules, the total annual production is 10 Mm3yr−1 (2–17 Mm3yr−1, 95% credibility interval) but is not maintained after the first logging cycle. Under the most sustainable scenario (see above) and a concession area of 35 Mha, the long-term sustainable annual production of timber reaches only 3.4 Mm3yr−1. Based on these results we argue that the concession system will not be able to supply the timber demand without substantial reforms in natural forest management practices and in the wood industry sector. We argue that alternative sources of timber, including plantations linked with forest restoration initiatives, must be promoted.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"119440","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Selectivelogging","Sustainable forest management","Amazonian forest concessions"]},{"key":"EVL5G5PV","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2011","author":[{"firstName":"Alongi","lastName":"Daniel M."}],"title":"Carbon payments for mangrove conservation: ecosystem constraints and uncertainties of sequestration potential","publication_title":"Environmental Science & Policy","issn":"1462-9011","doi":"10.1016/j.envsci.2011.02.004","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901111000177","abstract_note":"Natural ecosystem change over time is an often unconsidered issue for PES and REDD+ schemes, and a lack of consideration of thermodynamic limitations has led to misconceptions and oversimplifications regarding ecosystem services, especially for tropical mangrove forests.

Not all mangroves accumulate carbon and rates of forest floor accretion are directly linked to the frequency of tidal inundation. Carbon payments in either a PES or REDD+ scheme are dependent on the rate of carbon sequestration, not the size of C stocks, so site selection must be ordinarily confined to the sea edge. Gas emissions and net ecosystem production (NEP) are linked to forest age, particularly for monospecific plantations. Planting of mixed-species forests is recommended to maximize biodiversity, food web connectivity and NEP. Old-growth forests are the prime ecosystems for carbon sequestration, and policy must give priority to schemes to maintain their existence.

Human pressures on the continent's river systems have lead to widespread contamination, disruption of natural flow regimes, land-cover conversion, and overexploitation of riverine resources. Improved river resource management and sustainable development are inextricably linked in South America.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"404-413","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Geomorphology","Biodiversity","Ecology","South America","Pollution","Management","Discharge","River"]},{"key":"GYFCLP5Y","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Fischer","lastName":"Rico"},{"firstName":"Bohn","lastName":" Friedrich"},{"firstName":"Dantas de Paula","lastName":" Mateus"},{"firstName":"Dislich","lastName":" Claudia"},{"firstName":"Groeneveld","lastName":" Jürgen"},{"firstName":"Gutiérrez","lastName":" Alvaro G."},{"firstName":"Kazmierczak","lastName":" Martin"},{"firstName":"Knapp","lastName":" Nikolai"},{"firstName":"Lehmann","lastName":" Sebastian"},{"firstName":"Paulick","lastName":" Sebastian"},{"firstName":"Pütz","lastName":" Sandro"},{"firstName":"Rödig","lastName":" Edna"},{"firstName":"Taubert","lastName":" Franziska"},{"firstName":"Köhler","lastName":" Peter"},{"firstName":"Huth","lastName":" Andreas"}],"title":"Lessons learned from applying a forest gap model to understand ecosystem and carbon dynamics of complex tropical forests","publication_title":"Ecological Modelling","issn":"0304-3800","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.11.018","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380015005505","abstract_note":"Forests worldwide are threatened by various environmental and anthropogenic hazards, especially tropical forests. Knowledge on the impacts of these hazards on forest structure and dynamics has been compiled in empirical studies. However, the results of these studies are often not sufficient for long-term projections and extrapolations to large spatial scales especially for unprecedented environmental conditions, which require both the identification and understanding of key underlying processes. Forest models bridge this gap by incorporating multiple ecological processes in a dynamic framework (i.e. including a realistic model structure) and addressing the complexity of forest ecosystems. Here, we describe the evolution of the individual-based and process-based forest gap model FORMIND and its application to tropical forests. At its core, the model includes physiological processes on tree level (photosynthesis, respiration, tree growth, mortality, regeneration, competition). During the past two decades, FORMIND has been used to address various scientific questions arising from different forest types by continuously extending the model structure. The model applications thus provided understanding in three main aspects: (1) the grouping of single tree species into plant functional types is a successful approach to reduce complexity in vegetation models, (2) structural realism was necessary to analyze impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as logging, fragmentation, or drought, and (3) complex ecological processes such as carbon fluxes in tropical forests – starting from the individual tree level up to the entire forest ecosystem – can be explored as a function of forest structure, species composition and disturbance regime. Overall, this review shows how the evolution of long-term modelling projects not only provides scientific understanding of forest ecosystems, but also provides benefits for ecological theory and empirical study design.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"124-133","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Speciesrichness","Carbon balance","Disturbance","Forest simulations","FORMIND","Structural realism"]},{"key":"P3HNQYRP","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Guimaraes","lastName":"Aretha Franklin"},{"firstName":"de Souza","lastName":" Cléber Rodrigo"},{"firstName":"Rosa","lastName":" Clarissa"},{"firstName":"Paulo dos Santos","lastName":" Juliano"},{"firstName":"Teixeira","lastName":" Luis Antonio Fonseca"},{"firstName":"Zanzini","lastName":" Lucas Pereira"},{"firstName":"Santiago","lastName":" Wagner Tadeu Vieira"},{"firstName":"Zanzini","lastName":" Antônio Carlos da Silva"}],"title":"Small-scale environmental variations drive vegetation structure and diversity in Amazon riverine forests","publication_title":"Flora","issn":"0367-2530","doi":"10.1016/j.flora.2021.151916","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0367253021001559","abstract_note":"Riverine forests in the Brazilian Amazon provide a series of ecosystem services and harbor one of the world's most diverse floras, but the main drivers of variation in small spatial scales in such tropical forests are not well understood.

Altitude and groundwater depth were the main drivers influencing species diversity patterns. The trees had similar total biomass in areas within the same distance from the river margins. There was a lower species richness and tree density closer to the river margins. Otherwise, we found larger trees (higher individual biomass) closer to the river margins when compared to areas distant from the margins.

This study proposes a method for correlating international data on water scarcity and stress, saline water resources, and insolation levels, to calculate rank scores (0 ≤ R ≤ 1) which identify where solar desalination is most applicable. Low scores (R < 0.125) occur in landlocked nations with limited saline groundwater resources (Nepal, Bolivia, South Sudan) and near polar regions where fresh water is abundant and solar insolation levels are low (Canada, Russia and Scandinavia). High scores (R > 0.422) occur in 30 nations, including Middle Eastern and North African countries where fossil fuelled desalination is commonplace, and solar desalination has obvious applicability. The analysis identifies 28 further countries (including parts of USA, China, India, Indonesia, Australia, and countries throughout Africa, Asia, South America and Europe) where 0.273 < R < 0.422 scores indicate that other, less obvious, solar desalination opportunities exist.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"200-219","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Desalination","Solar energy","Water resources","Water-energy nexus"]},{"key":"STD6XPC7","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":""}],"title":"Contents by Subject Area","publication_title":"Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals (Third Edition)","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128043271000285","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"xv-xvi","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"B8DQVXCB","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2004","author":[{"firstName":"Sopo","lastName":"Raimo"}],"title":"Chapter 8 - Peat","publication_title":"2004 Survey of Energy Resources (Twentieth Edition)","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080444109500139","abstract_note":"Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation.

A real threat to the use of peat in the energy sector is constituted by carbon trading. Strong objections have been voiced to the industrial utilization of peatlands and many campaigns were organized in the 1990s to stop peat harvesting. If national solutions, such as taxation, are not used to balance the situation, calculated emissions from peat combustion based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) system are likely to lead to a very high cost of power and heat production from peat.

Under the pressure of rapid socioeconomic development, China has taken measures to protect its cultivated land from environmental degradation and protect its food security. By reviewing the research literature, we found several ways to increase the area of arable land while protecting this land from damage.

Thus, the past and recent changes in the geographic range of the most efficient vectors of T. cruzi to humans are well-known. However, an incomplete knowledge of species distribution exists when these organisms are restricted to sylvatic environments. It is unfeasible to systematically sample over wide areas because it is difficult to access certain types of ecotopes, thus making it difficult to investigate these areas. Moreover, in the case of exclusively sylvatic species, the sampling is generally random and, consequently, often unproductive. Finally, the sampled subsets are considered isolated species when they may represent components of an unknown continuous population.

While the combination of mountain uplift and continental weathering has been proposed as a major sink for atmospheric CO2 and a climate driver over geological timescales, this hypothesis is much debated and its potential importance in triggering the late Cretaceous global cooling is yet to be explored. In this work, we combined clay mineralogy, trace and major element concentrations, and a new proxy of silicate weathering intensity based on Nd and Hf isotopes (∆ɛHf(t)clay) to explore the potential links between the uplift of the brazilian margin, silicate weathering and climate evolution during the late Cretaceous. Our new ∆ɛHf(t)clay proxy data suggest - for the first time - that marked increase of silicate weathering intensity occurred in southeast Brazil during the late Cretaceous, from ~85 to 70 Ma, related to the tectonic uplift affecting the eastern South American margin at that time. Combined with clay mineralogical analyses, our Hf-Nd isotope data further suggests the existence of a relatively arid local climate during the Turonian-Santonian interval, during which physical disaggregation of rocks most likely prevailed, accompanying the uplift of the Brazilian margin. From the Santonian, we propose that the exposure of new high-elevation regions favored instead locally enhanced precipitations and more hydrolysing conditions, thereby promoting chemical weathering and atmospheric CO2 drawdown. Altogether, our multi-proxy investigation suggests that the uplift of the Brazilian margin could have contributed to the late Cretaceous cooling, potentially playing a key role in the onset of the last greenhouse-to-icehouse transition.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"120724","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Brazilianmargin","Clay mineralogy","Isotope geochemistry","Paleoclimate","Tectonic-climate interaction"]},{"key":"IF9A279R","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Moreira-Turcq","lastName":"Patricia"},{"firstName":"Carlo Espinoza","lastName":" Jhan"},{"firstName":"Filizola","lastName":" Naziano"},{"firstName":"Martinez","lastName":" Jean-Michel"}],"title":"Rivers of the Andes and the Amazon Basin: Deciphering global change from the hydroclimatic variability in the critical zone","publication_title":"Comptes Rendus Geoscience","issn":"1631-0713","doi":"10.1016/j.crte.2018.01.001","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631071318300026","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"1-3","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"ACMNL9DD","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Betancourt","lastName":"Mauricio"}],"title":"The effect of Cuban agroecology in mitigating the metabolic rift: A quantitative approach to Latin American food production","publication_title":"Global Environmental Change","issn":"0959-3780","doi":"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102075","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378019306703","abstract_note":"The historical development of capitalism created what Karl Marx called a rift in the social metabolism with nature, whereby soil nutrients were systematically siphoned into cities where they were discarded as waste and thus did not return to the land. An alternative mode of food production known as agroecology was developed by different scientists and activists partly to transcend this contradiction. Drawing on data from the United Nations and the World Bank, this work analyzes whether agroecology has contributed to mitigate the metabolic rift in agriculture in Cuba, the country where this approach to food production, adopted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, is more widely developed. By means of a panel model, both an internal comparison through time within Cuba and a cross-national comparison of Cuba with the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), were developed to determine whether the post-Soviet transition to agroecology in Cuba successfully decoupled industrial agricultural practices from productivity in comparison to other countries in LAC. Decoupling is understood as the removal of the positive correlation between fertilizer use and yield. Synthetic fertilizer use is utilized as an indicator of industrialized agriculture, and productivity of maize and beans as a proxy measure of soil improvement. The model shows a reversal of the fertilizer use and productivity positive correlation in Cuba, where crop productivity has increased while the use of inputs has diminished, which suggests that agroecology has indeed mitigated the metabolic rift produced by industrialized agriculture.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"102075","language":"en","automatic_tags":["agroecology","Cuba","decoupling","industrial agriculture","Metabolic rift"]},{"key":"ZAGECK74","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2005","author":[{"firstName":"Davy","lastName":"Anthony J."}],"title":"Museum specimens breathe life into plant conservation?","publication_title":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","issn":"0169-5347","doi":"10.1016/j.tree.2005.04.015","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534705001151","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"286-287","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"BKSDU3I4","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2014","author":[{"firstName":"Bates","lastName":"Samuel"},{"firstName":"Angeon","lastName":" Valérie"},{"firstName":"Ainouche","lastName":" Ahmed"}],"title":"The pentagon of vulnerability and resilience: A methodological proposal in development economics by using graph theory","publication_title":"Economic Modelling","issn":"0264-9993","doi":"10.1016/j.econmod.2014.07.027","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026499931400282X","abstract_note":"Several assessments of vulnerability and resilience have been attempted at a country level through composite indices but they are barely in accord with a holistic view of sustainable development.

Most of the documents released by the stakeholders can be considered to be grey literature. As the topic has not been properly discussed in the literature, there is an opportunity to bring the initiatives carried out by the space sector in recent years to the public domain. Thus, the present work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of past and present studies following the LCA framework. The review compiles 11 papers, conferences proceedings or technical reports that address the development of the LCA framework and good practices in the sector and 27 documents dedicated to LCA studies. On the one hand, the results highlight the emergence of a common framework regarding LCA practice in Europe. On the other hand, the analysed LCA case studies show a highly heterogeneous goal and scope definition. In this review, research needs and methodological challenges are identified and discussed. Finally, recommendations on how to implement and develop the use of LCA within the space industry are given in view of designing more sustainable space systems and associated missions.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"122-135","language":"en","automatic_tags":["ecodesign","environmental impact","life cycle assessment","space industry","space sustainability","space systems"]},{"key":"ABJADF4N","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2006","author":[{"firstName":"daCruz","lastName":" Denise Dias"},{"firstName":"Mello","lastName":" Marco A.

Twenty-four sampling sessions were conducted monthly between February 2001 and January 2003. Individuals of H. spathocircinata and of H. laneana var. flava were tagged within a transect of 4000×4m. Reproductive phenophases (flowering, unripe, and ripe fruits) were recorded, and circular statistics were used to test for the regularity and frequency of phenophases. Flower visitors were observed during two flowering periods for each species. Both species had well-defined and synchronous reproductive periods, with a small overlap, suggesting a sequential flowering model. Biotic and abiotic factors seem to affect phenophases of both species. However, herbarium data suggest that the flowering period in H. spathocircinata varies less than in H. laneana, despite its wider geographic distribution. The hummingbird Phaethornis idaliae was the main floral visitor of both Heliconia species studied. H. laneana was also legitimately visited by another hummingbird species, Glaucis hirsuta, and by Lepidoptera. Some Lepidoptera, particularly the bee Trigona spinipes, were illegitimate visitors (‘nectar robbers’). We suggest that the flower of H. spathocircinata allowed a wider array of visitors, because it is bigger.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"519-527","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Pollination","Atlantic forest","Brazil","Reproductive phenology","Sympatry"]},{"key":"2PJIRPEC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Watts","lastName":"Mirian"},{"firstName":"Winkler","lastName":" Isaac S."},{"firstName":"Daugeron","lastName":" Christophe"},{"firstName":"de Carvalho","lastName":" Claudio J.

Although Empidini itself is likely paraphyletic, many presumably monophyletic genera and species groups are recognized. Here, we apply DNA sequences from multiple genes to infer the phylogeny of Empidini, focusing on placing the Neotropical lineages within the entire tribe and identifying monophyletic groups. We included 98 Empidini taxa along with 18 outgrous terminals, spanning the diversity within the group. The results from the analyses performed are largely similar, with major groupings of genera in common. Specifically, the analyses recovered a monophyletic Hilarini and a paraphyletic Empidini. Most species from Chile and Argentina (Andean region) are found to belong to an early branching lineage within Empidinae, and are not monophyletic with other Empidini. A large portion of the remaining Neotropical Empidini (not Andean) comprises a single clade that includes four endemic genera and a number of Neotropical Empis Linneaus species. Macrostomus and Porphyrochroa each recovered as monophyletic and sister to one another, although generic placement of a few taxa remains uncertain due to conflicting morphological features. Lamprempis+Opeatocerata are also found to be sister-taxa in most analyses. Several large genera were found to be polyphyletic or paraphyletic including Empis and Rhamphomyia Meigen.

This paper argues that, in addition to its contemporary entrenchment within a neoliberal environment, this is also due to the nature of ‘sovereignty’ itself in a region which has been shaped by a distinctive colonial, social and economic history. In order to demonstrate this, firstly, it makes the case for why, in the context of rising food imports and enduring structural legacies, food sovereignty matters in the Anglo-Caribbean. Secondly, it charts changes in the regional policy of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to show how, despite repeated calls to increase self-sufficiency, conventional neoliberal approaches to agricultural development and food security have predominated since the 1970s. Finally, it identifies and analyses limited instances where food sovereignty discourses have been mobilized, by farmers’ groups and political actors, and interrogates the meaning of both ‘internal’ and ‘external’ sovereignty itself in this post-colonial context. It finds mobilisations of food sovereignty to be characterised by a repeated conflation of domestic food production with the concept’s ideological principles as a political project, and a particular understanding of sovereignty that places an emphasis on ‘the state’ and ‘the region’ over ‘the people’. This shows that the very nature of ‘sovereignty’ itself plays a critical role in both the translation of, and possibilities for mobilising ‘food sovereignty’ as a radical project as envisaged in the wider literature.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"90-99","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Caribbean","Food security","Agriculture","Food sovereignty","Neoliberalism","Sovereignty"]},{"key":"TUGDJT64","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"N'Guessan","lastName":"Anny Estelle"},{"firstName":"N'dja","lastName":" Justin Kassi"},{"firstName":"Yao","lastName":" Olivier N."},{"firstName":"Amani","lastName":" Bienvenu H.

Consequently 90% of the original rainforest cover has now disappeared and the remainder is heavily fragmented and highly degraded. Although many studies have focused on carbon stocks and fluxes in intact African forests, little information exists on biomass recovery rates in secondary forests. We studied a chronosequence of 96 secondary and old-growth forest fragments (0.2 ha each) where 32.103 trees with Diameter at Breast Height >2.5 cm have been censused. We modelled the biomass recovery trajectories in a time-explicit Bayesian framework and tested the effect on recovery rates of a large set of covariates related to the physical environment, plot history, and forest connectivity. Recovery rate trajectory is highly non-linear: recovery rates accelerated from 1 to 37 years, when biomass recovery reached 4.23 Mg·ha−1·yr−1, and decelerated afterwards. We predict that, on average, 10%, 25% and 50% of the old-growth forest biomass is respectively recovered 17, 30, and 51 years after abandonment. Recovery rates are strongly shaped by both the number of remnant trees (residuals of the former old-growth forest) and the previous crop cultivated before abandonment. The latter induced large differences in the time needed to recover 50% of an old-growth forest biomass: from 38 years for former Yam fields up to 86 years for former rice fields. Our results emphasize (i) the very slow recovery rates of West African forests, as compared to Neotropical forests (ii) the long-lasting impacts of past human activities and management choices on ecosystem biomass recovery in West African degraded forests.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"325-331","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"YR587Q25","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"deVries","lastName":" Sophia G."},{"firstName":"Bekedam","lastName":" Maud M.

The annual average fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O from Xiangxi River were 0.13±0.11mgm−2h−1, 16.01±23.21mgm−2h−1 and 21.57±12.75μgm−2h−1, respectively, which were significantly lower than those from tropical rivers or lakes. The GHG fluxes showed strong seasonal dynamics: CH4 was consistently released to the atmosphere and was more in summer than the other seasons. CO2 was absorbed from the atmosphere in spring, but was emitted the most in winter. N2O flux was higher in cold season than in warm season. Additionally, CH4 emission showed obvious spatial variations that decreased gradually from shallow to deep water-level areas. Correlation analysis demonstrated that CH4 emission was negatively correlated with water depth and air–water temperature difference, and positively with air temperature. CO2 flux was negatively related to chlorophyll a (Chl. a) and N2O flux was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO).

The first villages, ca. 4000 years cal BP later, created substantial shell-middens and disturbances in nearby forest areas. After another 4000 years cal BP in many regions, people turned to shifting horticulture, cutting and burning fields, disseminating crops, and planting trees.

Some settlements grew to urban proportions during the last 1000 years of prehistory, leaving large earth mounds of rich black cultural refuse. Their effects altered habitats widely but not destructively in terms of resources for human use. European invaders defeated the chiefdoms, decimated their populations, and pushed survivors to the peripheries. Post-colonial states continued forced migration and deculturation and instituted destructive industries, destroying valuable timberlands, bulldozing orchards, shell mounds, anthropic forests, and archeological sites, polluting waters, and causing wide erosion and savannization.

Its pollen is known from the Palaeocene, and has been widespread throughout the entire neotropical region, during the Tertiary. From the Late Miocene until the Pleistocene, populations have been progressively fragmented by the Andean orogeny, thus promoting local extinction in some smaller basins and allopatric speciation in others. During the Pleistocene, Mauritia survived the repeated dry and cool periods characteristic for glaciations either by restricting its distribution to assumed Amazon forest ‘refugia’ or by forming large-scale, heterogeneous forest communities. After the last glaciation, palynological studies document a broad dispersal process of Mauritia, leading to its present range. However, Holocene climatic shifts, together with human disturbance, created a heterogeneous distribution pattern with spatial and temporal differences within this process. Therefore, biogeographical inferences based on present-day observations can only account for the most recent changes and are not suitable for generalizations. The history of Mauritia derived from the fossil record suggests opportunities for both vicariance and allopatric speciation, and reveals dispersal patterns through time. The presence of Mauritia in sediments can also be used as a reliable indicator of warm tropical lowland environments flooded by fresh (occasionally oligohalyne) waters. Several hypothesis about its biogeographical history and its palaeoecological implications are offered that can be tested with future studies.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"109-122","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Neotropics","palynology","biogeography","evolution"]},{"key":"GJWJ5TMJ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Royer","lastName":"Aurélien"},{"firstName":"Malaizé","lastName":" Bruno"},{"firstName":"Lécuyer","lastName":" Christophe"},{"firstName":"Queffelec","lastName":" Alain"},{"firstName":"Charlier","lastName":" Karine"},{"firstName":"Caley","lastName":" Thibaut"},{"firstName":"Lenoble","lastName":" Arnaud"}],"title":"A high-resolution temporal record of environmental changes in the Eastern Caribbean (Guadeloupe) from 40 to 10 ka BP","publication_title":"Quaternary Science Reviews","issn":"0277-3791","doi":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.11.010","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379116305297","abstract_note":"In neotropical regions, fossil bat guano accumulated over time as laminated layers in caves, hence providing a high-resolution temporal record of terrestrial environmental changes. Additionally, cave settings have the property to preserve such organic sediments from processes triggered by winds (deflation, abrasion and sandblasting) and intense rainfall (leaching away). This study reports both stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of frugivorous bat guano deposited in a well-preserved stratigraphic succession of Blanchard Cave on Marie-Galante, Guadeloupe. These isotopic data are discussed with regard to climate changes and its specific impact on Eastern Caribbean vegetation during the Late Pleistocene from 40 to 10 ka cal. BP. Guano δ13C values are higher than modern ones, suggesting noticeable vegetation changes. This provides also evidence for overall drier environmental conditions during the Pleistocene compared to today. Meanwhile, within this generally drier climate, shifts between wetter and drier conditions can be observed. Large temporal amplitudes in both δ13C and δ15N variations reaching up to 5.9‰ and 16.8‰, respectively, also indicate these oceanic tropical environments have been highly sensitive to regional or global climatic forcing. Stable isotope compositions of bat guano deposited from 40 to 35 ka BP, the Last Glacial Maximum and the Younger-Dryas reveal relatively wet environmental conditions whereas, at least from the end of the Heinrich event 1 and the Bølling period the region experienced drier environmental conditions. Nevertheless, when considering uncertainties in the model age, the isotopic record of Blanchard Cave show relatively similar variations with known proxy records from the northern South America and Central America, suggesting thus that the Blanchard Cave record is a robust proxy of past ITCZ migration.

These analyses were complemented by data on land-to-water conversion and vice versa within a 2 km-wide coastal fringe, and on MERIS-derived seasonal and decadal-scale evolution of suspended particulate matter (SPM) off the delta. The objectives were to: (1) characterize the 450 km-long delta shoreline and coastal sediment transport pathways, (2) define the shoreline status (stability, erosion, accretion), and (3) identify potential causes of shoreline change and the future outcome of this status in terms of delta vulnerability. The delta shoreline was characterized on the basis of qualitative alongshore tidal, wave-energy, and sediment grain-size patterns (muddy, sandy or a mixture of both), and morphology (sandy beaches and mudflats). The deltaic coast exhibits a mixed wave-and-tide-dominated morphology and comprises a western sector characterized by four of the five main distributary mouths separating inter-distributary plains bounded by low overwash-influenced beaches devoid of aeolian dunes. The eastern sector, in the Gulf of Martaban, is embayed, much less prograded and bounded by dominantly muddy shores. This simple shoreline dichotomy reflects the overarching alongshore sediment redistribution and storage patterns that have accompanied the growth of the delta, resulting in the two facies: sand dominantly retained in the western sector where the multiple distributary mouths have constrained potential alongshore sand transport by low- to moderate-energy monsoon-generated southwesterly waves, and mud transported by the regional monsoon-influenced coastal shelf circulation towards the eastern sector. The recent multi-decadal shoreline mobility in the Ayeyarwady delta points to the influence of fluvial sediment supply on these two facies. Between 1974 and 2019, 49% of the delta's shoreline underwent erosion, mainly affecting the sandy beaches in the western sector, whereas shoreline accretion is still prevalent along the large inter-distributary plain east of Yangon, where coastal mud preferentially accumulates in the Gulf of Martaban. We attribute erosion to reduced river sand supply generated by dams and by massive in-channel sand mining upstream of the delta, exacerbated by important channel dredging. Large-scale deforestation resulting from land-use changes (agriculture and mining) in the Ayeyarwady catchment are probably contributing to enhanced fine-grained sediment supply to the delta plain and the coast, as reflected by the relative stability of coastal SPM over a decade (2002–2012) and continued deposition in the accreting eastern sheltered part of the delta. The coastal sediment balance will be further impacted in the future if planned dams are constructed. Without proper sediment management, notably a significant reduction or prohibition of in-channel sand mining, the sandy beaches that armour the wave-exposed western sector of the delta will continue to erode, resulting in increased potential exposure of the delta to cyclones and sea-level rise.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"106038","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Ayeyarwady","Coastal suspended particulate matter","Delta erosion","Gulf of Martaban","Monsoon-influenced delta","River sediment supply"]},{"key":"HKGRB4B6","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Resende","lastName":"Angélica Faria de"},{"firstName":"Schöngart","lastName":" Jochen"},{"firstName":"Streher","lastName":" Annia Susin"},{"firstName":"Ferreira-Ferreira","lastName":" Jefferson"},{"firstName":"Piedade","lastName":" Maria Teresa Fernandez"},{"firstName":"Silva","lastName":" Thiago Sanna Freire"}],"title":"Massive tree mortality from flood pulse disturbances in Amazonian floodplain forests: The collateral effects of hydropower production","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.208","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971835071X","abstract_note":"Large dams built for hydroelectric power generation alter the hydrology of rivers, attenuating the flood pulse downstream of the dam and impacting riparian and floodplain ecosystems. The present work mapped black-water floodplain forests (igapó) downstream of the Balbina Reservoir, which was created between 1983 and 1987 by damming the Uatumã River in the Central Amazon basin. We apply remote sensing methods to detect tree mortality resulting from hydrological changes, based on analysis of 56 ALOS/PALSAR synthetic aperture radar images acquired at different flood levels between 2006 and 2011. Our application of object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods and the random forests supervised classification algorithm yielded an overall accuracy of 87.2%. A total of 9800 km2 of igapó forests were mapped along the entire river downstream of the dam, but forest mortality was only observed below the first 49 km downstream, after the Morena rapids, along an 80-km river stretch. In total, 12% of the floodplain forest died within this stretch. We also detected that 29% of the remaining living igapó forest may be presently undergoing mortality. Furthermore, this large loss does not include the entirety of lost igapó forests downstream of the dam; areas which are now above current maximum flooding heights are no longer floodable and do not show on our mapping but will likely transition over time to upland forest species composition and dynamics, also characteristic of igapó loss. Our results show that floodplain forests are extremely sensitive to long-term downstream hydrological changes and disturbances resulting from the disruption of the natural flood pulse. Brazilian hydropower regulations should require that Amazon dam operations ensure the simulation of the natural flood-pulse, despite losses in energy production, to preserve the integrity of floodplain forest ecosystems and to mitigate impacts for the riverine populations.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"587-598","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazon","Tree mortality","Balbina","Black water river","Flood pulse","Hydropower dam","Object-based image analysis","PALSAR","Synthetic aperture radar","Uatumã River"]},{"key":"5WF7G68N","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2010","author":[{"firstName":"Groc","lastName":"Sarah"},{"firstName":"Delabie","lastName":" Jacques H.

Nevertheless, incorporating them into conservation surveys is expensive due to problems associated with their identification, which is exacerbated by the fact that there are fewer and fewer taxonomists working today. “Taxonomic sufficiency” (TS), which identifies organisms to a level of taxonomic resolution sufficient enough to satisfy the objectives of a study, has never been applied to Neotropical ant communities. We analysed five Neotropical datasets representing ant assemblages collected with different sampling methods in various habitats. We first treated them using two complementary and cumulative TS methods, higher-taxon and “indicator taxa” surrogacies, before testing a new approach called “mixed-level method” that combines the two previous approaches. For the higher-taxon surrogacy, we showed that, above species, genus is the most informative taxonomic level. Then, mixed-level method provided more information on ant assemblages than did the two others, even though the “indicator taxa” surrogacy was based on relevant indicator genera. Although habitat type has no effect on its efficiency, this new method is influenced by the dataset structure and the type of sampling method used to collect data. We have thus developed a new method for analyzing Neotropical ant faunas that enables the taxonomic work linked to the identification of problematic species to be significantly reduced, while conserving most of the information on the ant assemblage. This method should enhance the work of Neotropical entomologists not specialised in taxonomy, particularly those concerned with biological conservation and indication.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"2832-2839","language":"en","automatic_tags":["“Indicatortaxa” surrogacy","Biodiversity indicators","Higher-taxon surrogacy","Mixed-level method","Multi-taxonomic assemblages","Terrestrial arthropod assemblages"]},{"key":"7XV7YX6J","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2012","author":[{"firstName":"Pimentel","lastName":"Elizabeth T."},{"firstName":"Hamza","lastName":" Valiya M."}],"title":"Indications of regional scale groundwater flows in the Amazon Basins: Inferences from results of geothermal studies","publication_title":"Journal of South American Earth Sciences","issn":"0895-9811","doi":"10.1016/j.jsames.2012.03.007","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981112000375","abstract_note":"The present work deals with determination groundwater flows in the Amazon region, based on analysis of geothermal data acquired in shallow and deep wells. The method employed is based on the model of simultaneous heat transfer by conduction and advection in permeable media. Analysis of temperature data acquired in water wells indicates down flows of groundwaters with velocities in excess of 10−7m/s at depths less than 300m in the Amazonas basin. Bottom-hole temperature (BHT) data sets have been used in determining characteristics of fluid movements at larger depths in the basins of Acre, Solimões, Amazonas, Marajó and Barreirinhas. The results of model simulations point to down flow of groundwaters with velocities of the order of 10−8 to 10−9m/s, at depths of up to 4000m. No evidence has been found for up flow typical of discharge zones. The general conclusion compatible with such results is that large-scale groundwater recharge systems operate at both shallow and deep levels in all sedimentary basins of the Amazon region. However, the basement rock formations of the Amazon region are relatively impermeable and hence extensive down flow systems through the sedimentary strata are possible only in the presence of generalized lateral movement of groundwater in the basal parts of the sedimentary basins. The direction of this lateral flow, inferred from the basement topography and geological characteristics of the region, is from west to east, following roughly the course of surface drainage system of the Amazon River, with eventual discharge into the Atlantic Ocean. The estimated flow rate at the continental margin is 3287m3/s, with velocities of the order of 218m/year. It is possible that dynamic changes in the fluvial systems in the western parts of South American continent have been responsible for triggering alterations in the groundwater recharge systems and deep seated lateral flows in the Amazon region.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"214-227","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazonbasins","Deep lateral flows","Geothermal studies","Recharge systems","Regional scale groundwater flows"]},{"key":"EW35C3XT","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Castro","lastName":"Ítalo Braga"},{"firstName":"Machado","lastName":" Fabiano Bender"},{"firstName":"de Sousa","lastName":" Gabriela Tavares"},{"firstName":"Paz-Villarraga","lastName":" César"},{"firstName":"Fillmann","lastName":" Gilberto"}],"title":"How protected are marine protected areas: A case study of tributyltin in Latin America","publication_title":"Journal of Environmental Management","issn":"0301-4797","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111543","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479720314687","abstract_note":"Protected areas (PAs) are dedicated and managed to achieve long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. However, few studies have assessed contamination/pollution, one of the top five biodiversity threats, within these areas. In fact, more than 100,000 molecules used in consumer goods are potentially affecting over 250,000 protected areas distributed worldwide. As a result, chemical appraisal within PAs require specific approaches to be feasible. Herein, an approach for assessment of contamination in marine protected areas (MPAs) spread over large continental and/or global areas was proposed and tested using, as a case study, the impact of tributyltin (TBT) within Latin America. This approach included area delimitation, bibliographic survey, construction of attribute tables, data insertion in a Geographic Information System, overlapping with worldwide shapefiles of PAs, identification of affected PAs and evaluation of impacts using the outcomes against specific environmental quality guidelines/directives. A total of 259 records of TBT occurrence and/or its biological effect within 53 marine protected areas (including biosphere reserves, Ramsar sites and National parks) were gathered. Among affected species, were recorded 18 gastropods exhibiting imposex. In addition, 6 bivalves, 1 crustacean, and 3 fish species presenting TBT residues in tissues were seen in MPAs from Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Venezuela. Since levels of TBT recorded in several studied MPAs were enough do induce deleterious biological responses over marine biota, it was clear that conservancy goals of some “protected” areas are under threat. Considering that only TBT exposure was appraised, and these areas are likely to be concomitantly exposed to other classes of contaminants, the actual scenario can be even more frightening. Although initially applied as a TBT case study, the present approach enables an overview for other chemicals within protected areas worldwide.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"111543","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Chemicalimpact","Conservancy","Effectiveness","Imposex"]},{"key":"3EJL3CX5","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2009","author":[{"firstName":"Johnson","lastName":"Gregory C."},{"firstName":"Purkey","lastName":" Sarah G."}],"title":"Deep Caribbean Sea warming","publication_title":"Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers","issn":"0967-0637","doi":"10.1016/j.dsr.2008.12.011","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063708002562","abstract_note":"Data collected from hydrographic stations occupied within the Venezuelan and Columbian basins of the Caribbean Sea from 1922 through 2003 are analyzed to study the decadal variability of deep temperature in the region.

Relatively dense waters (compared to those in the deep Caribbean) from the North Atlantic spill over this sill to ventilate the deep Caribbean Sea.

Diameter increment was found to vary with tree size for most of the species studied. The relationships between diameter increment and tree size were mostly humpback-shaped. The trees with diameters close to or lower than the reference minimum cutting diameter generally grew faster than the average. We also found that tree growth could slow for 1–2 years after timber exploitation and was then spurred for at least 5 years. The tree growth response to logging was nevertheless species-specific.

The phylogenetic analyses support the reciprocal monophyly of the two genera, Conopophaga and Pittasoma. All species were monophyletic with the exception of C. lineata, as C. lineata cearae did not cluster with the other two C. lineata subspecies. Divergence time estimates for Conopophagidae suggested that diversification took place during the Neogene, and that the diversification rate within Conopophaga clade was highest in the late Miocene, followed by a slower diversification rate, suggesting a diversity-dependent pattern. Our analyses of the diversification of family Conopophagidae provided a scenario for evolution in Terra Firme forest across tropical South America.

Yet, the quantitative assessment of the spatiotemporal variation of the inherent synchronous association between SSCC and SST at large spatial and temporal scales is still lacking. Accordingly, in the present study a synthetic approach was proposed that combines wavelet coherency analysis (WCA) with Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) modeling and hotspot analysis in order to evaluate the association between SSCC and SST globally during the period July 2002-February 2019. The WCA-based statistical results showed that SSCC has strong association with SST; particularly strong synchronous variations between SSCC and SST were found at the 1-year and the 5-year periods. During the 1-year period, cluster characteristics were explored in the BME-generated space–time maps of the association strength as well as in the corresponding hotspot maps. Geographically, high association strengths between SSCC and SST were detected in the mid-latitude regions of the Pacific Ocean, in the south and north of the tropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean, and in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. Temporally, most of the sub-regions exhibited a stable level of association strength during the entire study period (only a few sub-regions exhibited fluctuations or a slightly decreasing association strength trend). In conclusion, by assimilating the available knowledge bases at each grid point the proposed synthetic approach assessed quantitatively the strength of the periodic association between SSCC and SST globally; and the approach could be employed to map the space–time variation of the association strength between related natural attributes in the space–time-frequency domain.","date_added":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","date_modified":"2022-05-16 17:00:57","pages":"102620","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Seasurface temperature","Association","Bayesian maximum entropy","Moran effect","Sea surface chlorophyll","Spatiotemporal interpolation","Wavelet coherency"]},{"key":"ZSTX4MFM","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2008","author":[{"firstName":"Tougard","lastName":"Christelle"},{"firstName":"Renvoisé","lastName":" Elodie"}],"title":"Rodents and palaeogenetics: New perspectives","publication_title":"Comptes Rendus Palevol","issn":"1631-0683","doi":"10.1016/j.crpv.2007.12.002","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631068307001625","abstract_note":"Rodents are the most diversified mammalian order (484 extant genera including 2277 species), and they have a worldwide distribution.

Numerous studies have investigated the sediment dynamics and sedimentary evolution of the deposit, but several key questions remain unanswered due to insufficient observations. To reveal the mechanisms of sediment dynamics and quantify sediment transport and deposition processes, this study collected field datasets in the depocenter of the muddy deposit off the Shandong Peninsula. Bottom mounted tripods were deployed from August 18 to 27, 2017, and from February 23 to March 2, 2018, during which two strong wind events with speeds of over 10.8 m/s occurred. The results showed that near-bed suspended sediment concentration responded directly to varying hydrodynamic conditions, and significant differences in suspended sediment concentration between two wind events could be ascribed to a number of factors (e.g., tidal current, wave periods, wind stress, turbulence). The harmonic analysis demonstrated that suspended sediment variations during the spring tide were directed mainly by resuspension, while resuspension and advection contributed equally at neap tide. The variations in background suspended sediment concentration can be ascribed to the residual current. Furthermore, the sediment transport pattern is similar to the pattern of water circulation. Generally, the along-shore suspended sediment flux is about one order of magnitude higher than the cross-shore flux. In summer, the suspended sediment was transported mainly downcoast. In winter, sediment was transported downcoast during wavy periods and upcoast during calm periods. Advection dominated sediment flux in most cases, except during wavy periods when local resuspension increased significantly, and the contribution of resuspension term to along-shore flux was up to 87%. Meanwhile, cross-shore flux also increased significantly under strong winds, which was simultaneously modulated by downcoast and offshore winds. After statistical analysis, we found that offshore winds controlled the cross-shore sediment transport in winter. Using parameterized calculation and statistical analysis, the average accumulation rate of the study site was estimated to be 0.6 cm/yr. During calm periods, lower background sediment concentration in summer led to lower deposition rates than in winter. In addition, the frequent strong wind events in winter cause extremely high erosion rates. This study provides new perspectives on quantitative variations in suspended sediment transport and regional erosion/deposition from synoptic to seasonal variations in the distal mud deposit.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"104763","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Accumulationrate","Coastal sediment dynamics","Muddy deposit","Strong wind events","Suspended sediment transport"]},{"key":"BWH3D6H8","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zongyao"},{"firstName":"Yu","lastName":" Xueying"},{"firstName":"Dedman","lastName":" Simon"},{"firstName":"Rosso","lastName":" Massimiliano"},{"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":" Jingmin"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":" Jiaqi"},{"firstName":"Xia","lastName":" Yuxiang"},{"firstName":"Tian","lastName":" Yichao"},{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":" Guangping"},{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":" Jingzhen"}],"title":"UAV remote sensing applications in marine monitoring: Knowledge visualization and review","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155939","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722030364","abstract_note":"With the booming development of information technology and the growing demand for remote sensing data, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology has emerged.

A terrestrial origin for the odd carbon-numbered long-chain (>C27) n-alkanes has been inferred from molecular distributions. A shift in the n-alkane δ13C values across the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary coincides with a climate-induced floral change previously deduced from palynological analyses. Dry conditions during the late Pleistocene and mid-Holocene were confirmed by several n-alkane indices used to estimate the availability of moisture and by larger δD values. High ACL values indicate relatively dry conditions from 29 to 18.2 cal kyr BP and again from 8.0 and 5.0 cal kyr BP with a decrease in precipitation and an increase of grasses. Changes in the n-alkane C-29 isotopic compositions (δD and δ13C) were observed during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, coinciding with a floristic change induced by climatic conditions that is also observed in palynological results from the same lake. The n-alkane C-29 δ13C values remain between −33.2‰ and − 35.7‰, which is representative for n-alkanes derived from C3 vegetation. These lines of evidence suggest a continuous gallery forest cover in the Saci Lake catchment for the last ~35 cal kyr BP in contrasted with the observed palynological changes which represent the dynamics of the vegetation on the upland areas. The n-alkane C-29 δD values are less negative in the Pleistocene and more negative during the Holocene in the lake record. These characteristics suggest more humid conditions during the Holocene than in the Pleistocene, probably associated with the South American Monsoon System (SAMS). However, an increase of approximately 10‰ occurs during the late Holocene, which coincides with the forest expansion around 5 cal kyr BP that is recorded in palynological data of Saci Lake and other records of the Amazon Forest. This change suggests that the D/H ratio is also influenced by the increase of the plant biomass, which would provide an enrichment of D in the isotopic signal as a function of regional moisture recycling caused by evapotranspiration.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"103833","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Vegetation","Compound specific isotope composition","Paleoclimate, -Alkane","Southeastern Amazon basin"]},{"key":"6H2WRY8K","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Condé","lastName":"Tiago Monteiro"},{"firstName":"Tonini","lastName":" Helio"},{"firstName":"Higuchi","lastName":" Niro"},{"firstName":"Higuchi","lastName":" Francisco Gasparetto"},{"firstName":"Lima","lastName":" Adriano José Nogueira"},{"firstName":"Barbosa","lastName":" Reinaldo Imbrozio"},{"firstName":"dos Santos Pereira","lastName":" Taiguara"},{"firstName":"Haas","lastName":" Manuel Alexander"}],"title":"Effects of sustainable forest management on tree diversity, timber volumes, and carbon stocks in an ecotone forest in the northern Brazilian Amazon","publication_title":"Land Use Policy","issn":"0264-8377","doi":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106145","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837722001727","abstract_note":"The tension between the large global demand for tropical timber, and ecological sustainability and local socioeconomic development in the fragile natural ecosystems of the Amazon region has challenged many generations. In this case study, carried out in an ecotone forest in the northern Brazilian Amazon, we seek to demonstrate how forest management can became more sustainable through silvicultural prescriptions that reduce forest degradation and soil erosion. We evaluated the effects of the sustainable forest management (SFM) on tree diversity, timber volumes, and carbon stocks. A continuous forest inventory was carried out in nine 1-ha permanent plots (900 subplots of 100 m²), distributed in three treatments with three repetitions: T1 = control without selective logging, T2 = SFM, and T3 = SFM + silvicultural treatment of thinning release by tree girdling and poisoning. SFM was carried out with an average of three commercial timber trees harvested per hectare with DBH (diameter at breast height) ≥ 50 cm, corresponding to a timber volume of 20 ± 6 m3 ha-1, equivalent to the removal of 7 ± 2 Mg C ha-1 (5% of the original C). The formation of clearings (gaps) arising from the falling of exploited trees (0.12 ± 0.09 ha) resulted in greater impacts on the forest structure than the construction of 4 m skidder trails (0.06 ± 0.04 ha), with an average of 7 ± 4 damaged trees ha-1 and 5 ± 3 dead trees ha-1. Although six trees species became locally extinct, tree diversity was little altered, and timber volumes and forest carbon volume stocks remained essentially constant at this average logging intensity. Based on our results, sustainable forest management can become an efficient model for land use in the Amazon when harvesting is carried out using this average logging intensity. However, long-term monitoring studies using permanent plots in ecotone forests in the Brazilian Amazon will still be necessary. Quantifying, evaluating, and reporting impacts related to forest management will enable the formation of an empirical basis to support sustanaible forestry practices and for updating environmental legislation, contributing to local socioeconomic development, and maintaining the environmental services provided globally by tropical forests.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"106145","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Selectivelogging","Tropical forest","Land use","Forest carbon","Sustainable timber production"]},{"key":"J49TKLTR","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Lemes","lastName":"Priscila"},{"firstName":"Barbosa","lastName":" Fabiana G."},{"firstName":"Naimi","lastName":" Babak"},{"firstName":"Araújo","lastName":" Miguel B."}],"title":"Dispersal abilities favor commensalism in animal-plant interactions under climate change","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155157","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722022501","abstract_note":"Scientists still poorly understand how biotic interactions and dispersal limitation jointly interact and affect the ability of species to track suitable habitats under climate change. Here, we examine how animal-plant interactions and dispersal limitations might affect the responses of Brazil nut-dependent frogs facing projected climate change.

With the exception of one species, projections point to a decrease in suitable habitats of up to 40.6%. For frog species with potential reductions of co-occurrence areas, this is expected to reduce up to 23.8% of suitable areas for binomial animal-plant relationships. Even so, biotic interactions should not be lost over time. Species will depend on their own dispersal abilities to reach analogous climates in the future for maintaining ecological and evolutionary processes associated with commensal taxa. However, ecological and evolutionary processes associated with commensal taxa should be maintained in accordance with their own dispersal ability. When dispersal limitation is included in the models, the suitable range of all three frog species is reduced considerably by the end of the century. This highlights the importance of dispersal limitation inclusion for forecasting future distribution ranges when biotic interactions matter.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"155157","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Bioticinteraction","Changing climate","Dispersal limitation","Ecological niche model","Frog-plant interaction","MigClim"]},{"key":"2SI4JJVV","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Reis","lastName":"Luiza Santos"},{"firstName":"Bouloubassi","lastName":" Ioanna"},{"firstName":"Mendez-Millan","lastName":" Mercedes"},{"firstName":"Guimarães","lastName":" José Tasso Felix"},{"firstName":"de Araújo Romeiro","lastName":" Luiza"},{"firstName":"Sahoo","lastName":" Prafulla Kumar"},{"firstName":"Pessenda","lastName":" Luiz Carlos Ruiz"}],"title":"Hydroclimate and vegetation changes in southeastern Amazonia over the past ∼25,000 years","publication_title":"Quaternary Science Reviews","issn":"0277-3791","doi":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107466","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027737912200097X","abstract_note":"Stable isotope analysis of plant waxes (δ13Cwax and δDwax) along with detailed pollen data provide a new perspective on vegetation and precipitation variability in Serra Sul de Carajás, southeastern (SE) Amazonia, over the past ∼25 cal kyr BP.

To address this bias, an evaluation dataset was compiled using eddy covariance data from 40 sites between latitudes 30° S and 30° N. The flux data were obtained from the emerging network in Mexico (MexFlux) and from openly available databases of FLUXNET, AsiaFlux, and OzFlux. This unique reference dataset was then used to evaluate remote sensing-based ET products in environments that have been underrepresented in earlier studies. The evaluated products were: MODIS ET (MOD16, both the discontinued collection 5 (C5) and the latest collection (C6)), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) ET, and Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) ET. Products were compared with unadjusted fluxes (ETorig) and with fluxes corrected for the lack of energy balance closure (ETebc). Three common statistical metrics were used: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and percent bias (PBIAS). The effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on product evaluation results was investigated by examining the relationship between the statistical metrics and product-specific vegetation match indexes. Evaluation results of this study and those published in the literature were used to examine the performance of the products across latitudes. Differences between the MOD16 collection 5 and 6 datasets were generally smaller than differences with the other products. Performance and ranking of the evaluated products depended on whether ETorig or ETebc was used. When using ETorig, GLEAM generally had the highest R2, smallest PBIAS, and best RMSE values across the studied land cover types and climate zones. Neither MOD16 nor ALEXI performed consistently better than the other. When using ETebc, none of the products stood out in terms of both low bias and strong correlations. The use of ETebc instead of ETorig affected the biases more than the correlations.

The latitudinal comparison showed tendencies of lower R2 (all products) but better PBIAS and normalized RMSE values (MOD16 and GLEAM) for forests at low latitudes than for forests at northern middle latitudes. For non-forest vegetation, the products showed no clear latitudinal differences in performance.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"127786","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Tropics","ALEXI","GLEAM","MOD16","Subtropics"]},{"key":"9H7PCYM2","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Ellwanger","lastName":"Joel Henrique"},{"firstName":"Chies","lastName":" José Artur Bogo"}],"title":"Candida auris emergence as a consequence of climate change: Impacts on Americas and the need to contain greenhouse gas emissions","publication_title":"The Lancet Regional Health - Americas","issn":"2667-193X","doi":"10.1016/j.lana.2022.100250","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X22000679","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"100250","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"MHTIUEIF","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Ye"},{"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":" Jingni"},{"firstName":"Liu","lastName":" Tong"},{"firstName":"Liu","lastName":" Peiwen"},{"firstName":"Wu","lastName":" Yang"},{"firstName":"Lai","lastName":" Zetian"},{"firstName":"Gu","lastName":" Jinbao"},{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":" Xiaoguang"}],"title":"Assessing the risk of spread of Zika virus under current and future climate scenarios","publication_title":"Biosafety and Health","issn":"2590-0536","doi":"10.1016/j.bsheal.2022.03.012","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053622000349","abstract_note":"Zika virus (ZIKV) may cause severe microcephaly in newborn babies and Guillain-Barré syndrome in some adults. In recent decades, its range has expanded in 86 countries. There are two ecologically and evolutionarily district cycles: urban cycle and sylvatic cycle. This work aimed to estimate the urban and sylvatic cycle areas of ZIKV throughout the world. The occurrence records of vectors, non-human primate hosts, and ZIKV were collected. We chose historical climate data, predicted vectors distribution, human population density, and elevation data as the variables to fit the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). Current risk area and future prediction were performed with global climate models (GCMs) and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Predicting the ZIKV risk area would help tailor related control strategies. The results indicated that 16.6% of the world’s landmass (except Antarctica) is a risk area in the urban cycle. Approximately 6.22 billion people (78.69% of the global population) live in the risk area, with the vast majority in South Asia, tropical Africa, South America, North America, and countries around the Mediterranean Sea. Future climate change decreases the risk area of ZIKV. This study also suggested that the sylvatic cycle happened between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The overlap region of the urban and sylvatic cycles could be hotpots that ZIKV spill from the sylvatic to the urban cycle. It is indicated that long-term passenger screening, mosquito surveillance, and control are necessary.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Speciesdistribution modeling","MaxEnt","Sylvatic cycle","ti","Urban cycle","Zika virus"]},{"key":"LGW2ZAXI","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Cuilleret","lastName":"Mathieu"},{"firstName":"Doyen","lastName":" Luc"},{"firstName":"Gomes","lastName":" Hélène"},{"firstName":"Blanchard","lastName":" Fabian"}],"title":"Resilience management for coastal fisheries facing with global changes and uncertainties","publication_title":"Economic Analysis and Policy","issn":"0313-5926","doi":"10.1016/j.eap.2022.03.016","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0313592622000455","abstract_note":"Operationalizing resilience in fisheries management is a challenging issue in the face of global changes.

To this end, a dynamic multi-species, resource-based and multi-fleet model accounting for climate and socio-economic uncertainties is developed and calibrated using catch and effort time series. The search for a more resilient management leads us to compare different fishing management strategies and projections including ‘Business as usual’ (bau), ‘Multispecies Maximum Sustainable Yield’ (mmsy) and ‘Multispecies Maximum Economic Yield’ (mmey) strategies. The comparison between the strategies relies on ecological–economic viability goals and thresholds. The two normative strategies mmsy and mmey turn out to provide major gains in terms of the 3Rs and ecological–economic resilience as compared to bau. They both suggest major redistributions in the fishing effort of the different fleets.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"634-656","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Resilience","Climate warming","Coastal fishery","Demographic pressure","Models of intermediate complexity (MICE)","Oil price uncertainty"]},{"key":"ZII239JD","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Dejean","lastName":"Alain"},{"firstName":"Petitclerc","lastName":" Frédéric"},{"firstName":"Compin","lastName":" Arthur"},{"firstName":"Azémar","lastName":" Frédéric"},{"firstName":"Talaga","lastName":" Stanislas"},{"firstName":"Corbara","lastName":" Bruno"}],"title":"Climate change impact on Amazonian ant gardens","publication_title":"Basic and Applied Ecology","issn":"1439-1791","doi":"10.1016/j.baae.2022.02.004","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179122000159","abstract_note":"In Amazonia higher Atlantic sea surface temperatures, greenhouse gasses, deforestation and El Niño events result in the greater frequency of severe droughts, although total rainfall has increased due to wetter rainy seasons, something confirmed in French Guiana from available climatic data (1980–2017).

The detrimental effect of forest fires is particularly relevant in regions where fire has been historically absent or has rarely occurred. Nowadays, there is an increasing interest to promote and develop ecological restoration (ER) following fire. LAC constitutes a hotspot where work and interest in ER has been steadily increasing over the last decades, mainly due to the drive of a new generation of young and experienced ecologists and foresters. Despite the increasing attention in post-fire restoration in the region, there is a dearth of initiatives compiling and organizing all the available information on this topic. This work aims to address such constraint, providing current information on post-fire ER in LAC forests. After a brief contextualization of environmental and social consequences of wildfires, we collect and discuss recent advances on restoring degraded forests. From the conifer Mexican ecosystems to the Southern Patagonian evergreen forests, we look back over the last two decades (2000–2020) mainly discussing experiences of success and failure, as well as limitations of implementing approaches based on passive/natural restoration or active/assisted restoration. Furthermore, we also explore other aspects of the restoration process, including those related to social participation and community engagement (e.g. education in restored areas), the use of fire regulation and management to reduce fire risks and increase ecosystem resilience, educational aspects and intermediate approaches as agroforestry and silviculture practices. In the last sections, we identify three major categories of specific constraints that condition ER, including environmental limitations (biotic and abiotic factors), technical/management factors and the socio-economic challenge of restoration. Finally, we briefly discuss future perspectives for ER in LAC.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"120083","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Forestdegradation","Natural/assisted restoration","Postfire restoration","Social participation","Socio-economic limitations","Wildfires"]},{"key":"EZP74AVY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Rama","lastName":"Fabrizio"},{"firstName":"Busico","lastName":" Gianluigi"},{"firstName":"Arumi","lastName":" José Luis"},{"firstName":"Kazakis","lastName":" Nerantzis"},{"firstName":"Colombani","lastName":" Nicolò"},{"firstName":"Marfella","lastName":" Luigi"},{"firstName":"Hirata","lastName":" Ricardo"},{"firstName":"Kruse","lastName":" Eduardo E."},{"firstName":"Sweeney","lastName":" Paul"},{"firstName":"Mastrocicco","lastName":" Micòl"}],"title":"Assessment of intrinsic aquifer vulnerability at continental scale through a critical application of the drastic framework: The case of South America","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153748","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722008403","abstract_note":"An assessment of the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability of South America is presented. The outcomes represent the potential sensitivity of natural aquifers to leaching of dissolved compounds from the land surface. The study, developed at continental scale but retaining regionally a high resolution, is based on a critical application of the DRASTIC method. The biggest challenge in performing such a study in South America was the scattered and irregular nature of environmental datasets. Accordingly, the most updated information on soil, land use, geology, hydrogeology, and climate at continental, national, and regional scale were selected from international and local databases. To avoid spatial discrepancy and inconsistency, data were integrated, harmonized, and accurately cross-checked, using local professional knowledge where information was missing. The method was applied in a GIS environment to allow spatial analysis of raw data along with the overlaying and rating of maps. The application of the DRASTIC method allows to classify South America into five vulnerability classes, from very low to very high, and shows an overall medium to low vulnerability at continental scale. The Amazon region, coastal aquifers, colluvial Andean valleys, and alluvial aquifers of main rivers were the areas classified as highly vulnerable. Moreover, countries with the largest areas with high aquifer vulnerability were those characterized by extended regions of rainforest. In addition, a single parameter sensitivity analysis showed depth to water table to be the most significant factor, while a cross-validation using existing vulnerability assessments and observed concentrations of compounds in groundwater confirmed the reliability of the proposed assessment, even at regional scale. Overall, although additional field surveys and detailed works at local level are needed to develop effective water management plans, the present DRASTIC map represents an essential common ground towards a more sustainable land-use and water management in the whole territory of South America.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"153748","language":"en","automatic_tags":["SouthAmerica","DRASTIC","GIS","Groundwater","High-resolution maps","Intrinsic groundwater vulnerability"]},{"key":"LZ8S6TRW","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Martins-Junior","lastName":"Antonio M.

The number of species in the genus varies from one to nine, depending on the author, and there are at least 18 known karyotypes, varying from 2n = 46 to 2n = 58. Historically, night monkeys are divided into two species groups: red- and grey-necked groups from south and north of the Amazon-Solimões River, respectively. Here, we used 10 nuclear and 10 mitochondrial molecular markers from a wide taxonomic and geographic sample to infer phylogeny, divergence times, and biogeography of the genus. For phylogenetic reconstruction we used Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inferences (BI). Biogeographic models were generated using the ‘BioGeoBEARS’ software. We found support for nine taxa of Aotus and rejected the existence of monophyletic “red necked” and “grey necked” species groups. We suggest a taxonomic reclassification of the genus, which is better represented by two clades named northern group, which contains Aotus miconax, A. nancymae, A. trivirgatus, A. vociferans, A. lemurinus, A. griseimembra, A. zonalis, and A. brumbacki, and southern group, which contains A. nigriceps, A. boliviensis, A. infulatus, and A. azarae. The results suggest that the most recent common ancestor of all species of Aotus arose in the central Amazon basin in the Early Pliocene. The evolutionary history of night monkeys was guided by dispersal, vicariance and founder events. The end of the Andean uplift and the subsequent changes in the Amazon landscape, as well as the Amazon-Solimões and Tapajós rivers may have played an important role in the origin and diversification of Aotus, respectively. However, most of the Amazonian rivers seem not to have been geographical barriers to dispersal of night monkeys. The herein named southern group is fruit of a very recent diversification guided by dispersal, crossing the Tapajós, Xingú, Tocantins, and Guapore rivers and reaching the Cerrado in the last 1.6 My.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"107426","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Phylogeography","Andean uplift","Molecular systematics","Owl monkeys"]},{"key":"ZFLWNSWP","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Ribeiro-Souza","lastName":"Paula"},{"firstName":"Graipel","lastName":" Maurício E."},{"firstName":"Astúa","lastName":" Diego"},{"firstName":"Vancine","lastName":" Maurício Humberto"},{"firstName":"Pires","lastName":" José Salatiel Rodrigues"}],"title":"Effects of climate change on distribution and areas that protect two neotropical marsupials associated with aquatic environments","publication_title":"Ecological Informatics","issn":"1574-9541","doi":"10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101570","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157495412200019X","abstract_note":"The contraction of the amount of suitable habitat due to climate change can result in a species becoming threatened with extinction.

Our results indicated that both species will suffer a significant restriction of their potential distributions until 2050. Our models predicted that the loss of suitable areas will be greater for C. minimus, with only ~33% of the original distribution area remaining. The models also indicated that the current system of Fully Protected Areas in the Neotropical region will protect L. crassicaudata in a small area of its current and future potential distribution, inserted in climatically stable areas (~14%). These scenarios for these species support strong impacts on the biodiversity protection in aquatic environments in the Neotropical region.

From this body of knowledge, we identify key differences in the geographies of energy poverty identified by different metrics, with energy services-based approaches generally indicating higher vulnerability within rural areas, while energy expenditure metrics point towards higher risk in urban areas. We also find a dominance of quantitative approaches that tend to use existing (and often limited) forms of survey data, and a relative absence of detailed qualitative research.

This paper presents the development of the models used to create GEDI’s footprint-level (~25 m) AGBD (GEDI04_A) product, including a description of the datasets used and the procedure for final model selection. The data used to fit our models are from a compilation of globally distributed spatially and temporally coincident field and airborne lidar datasets, whereby we simulated GEDI-like waveforms from airborne lidar to build a calibration database. We used this database to expand the geographic extent of past waveform lidar studies, and divided the globe into four broad strata by Plant Functional Type (PFT) and six geographic regions. GEDI’s waveform-to-biomass models take the form of parametric Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models with simulated Relative Height (RH) metrics as predictor variables. From an exhaustive set of candidate models, we selected the best input predictor variables, and data transformations for each geographic stratum in the GEDI domain to produce a set of comprehensive predictive footprint-level models. We found that model selection frequently favored combinations of RH metrics at the 98th, 90th, 50th, and 10th height above ground-level percentiles (RH98, RH90, RH50, and RH10, respectively), but that inclusion of lower RH metrics (e.g. RH10) did not markedly improve model performance. Second, forced inclusion of RH98 in all models was important and did not degrade model performance, and the best performing models were parsimonious, typically having only 1-3 predictors. Third, stratification by geographic domain (PFT, geographic region) improved model performance in comparison to global models without stratification. Fourth, for the vast majority of strata, the best performing models were fit using square root transformation of field AGBD and/or height metrics. There was considerable variability in model performance across geographic strata, and areas with sparse training data and/or high AGBD values had the poorest performance.

Attempts to quantify the value of carbon capture in native species restoration efforts in the tropics are limited. This case study analyzed the rates of biomass (C) accumulation in restored plots in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Annual biomass (C) accumulation averaged 5.34kg per tree over the first 17years after seedling planting. This converts to an average capture of 19.57kg of CO2 tree−1year−1. Carbon sequestration rates in the first decade of growth are low at 1.95kgCyear−1 and carbon offset programs should account for this by requiring a minimum 15-year commitment for emission mitigation. Using an average tree planting and survival estimate per hectare, based on our 20-year restoration program, reforestation in this region can capture up to 12.72Mg (with just planted trees), or 15.7CO2Mgha−1year−1 when natural tree recruitment in restored plots is included. Great variation exists among tree planting sites, as well as within sites, and captured amounts differ with tree species capabilities.

Total mercury can be analyzed in water, air, and biological material by cold vapor atomic absorption methods and by neutron activation analysis and can be detected down to concentrations of a 10th of a nanogram per gram in biological material. Methylmercury (MeHg) can be detected in biological material at levels of a few nanograms by extraction with benzene after strong acidification with hydrochloric acid, followed by gas chromatographic analysis of MeHg chloride. Other analytical methods for speciating inorganic mercury and several of the organomercurial forms have also been published. These methods include isotope dilution mass spectrometry, time-of-flight mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis-ICP, gas chromatography-ICP, and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Mercury is circulated naturally in the biosphere, with 5500 metric tons (t) being released into the atmosphere by degassing from the Earth's crust and the oceans. In addition, 2500 t of mercury are released into the environment each year through human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels and other industrial releases. Approximately 2000 tons of mercury per year is produced for industrial use, a small part of which is used for synthesizing organic mercury compounds. The world production of mercury for commercial uses has been slowly declining over the past 20 years. There is now a ban on the export of mercury from the European Union and the United States. In nature, MeHg is produced from inorganic mercury as a consequence of microbial activity. In mammals, oxidative demethylation occurs in vivo to produce inorganic mercury. In fish, most mercury is present as MeHg. Factors determining the MeHg concentration in fish are the mercury content in water and bottom sediments, the pH and redox potential of water, and the species, age, and size of the fish. The toxic properties of mercury vapor are a consequence of mercury accumulation in the brain causing neurological signs involving an unspecific psychasthenic and vegetative syndrome (micromercurialism). At high exposure levels, mercurial tremor is seen, accompanied by severe behavioral and personality changes, increased excitability, loss of memory, and insomnia. Mercurials may also affect other organ systems, such as the kidney. On a group basis, exposure levels are likely to be reflected by mercury concentrations in the blood and urine. Occupational exposure to mercury concentrations in air of >0.1mg/m3 may produce mercurialism. Micromercurialism has not been reported at concentrations <0.01mg/m3. Exposure to mercury vapor inhibits brain development in primates and in humans with certain genotypes. The exact dose–response relationship in humans is not known. Inorganic mercury, but not MeHg, has been found to induce and bind to the low molecular weight metal-binding protein, metallothionein. The acute and long-term actions of mercuric salts, phenylmercury compounds, and alkoxyalkylmercury compounds are likely to be gastrointestinal disturbance and renal damage appearing as tubular dysfunction, with tubular necrosis in severe cases. The lethal dose in humans is approximately 1g mercuric salt. The mercury load on the kidney is best determined by analysis of renal biopsy. Mercury concentrations in the kidney of between 10 and 70mg/kg have been reported in poison cases with renal injury. Levels <3mg/kg may be found in normal cases. Occasionally, mercuric compounds may cause idiosyncratic skin symptoms, which may develop into severe exfoliative dermatitis or cause glomerular nephritis. Animal and clinical observations have shown that mercuric mercury stimulates and MeHg inhibits the immune system. A specific form of idiosyncrasy, called acrodynia or pink disease, is seen in children. Most cases are associated with mercury exposure in which increased levels of mercury in urine are detected. Hazards involved in the long-term intake of food containing MeHg or ethylmercury (EthylHg) and in occupational exposure to MeHg are a result of the efficient absorption (90%) of alkylmercury in humans and the long retention time (half-life of 70 days for MeHg and shorter for EthylHg) leading to accumulation of alkylmercury in the brain. Chronic poisoning results in degeneration and atrophy of the sensory cerebral cortex, paresthesia, ataxia, hearing, and visual impairment, and an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The latter effects are attenuated by the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) through fish consumption. Prenatal exposure causes cerebral palsy and, in less severe cases, psychomotor retardation. MeHg concentration in the blood and hair reflects the body burden and the brain concentration of MeHg. Intake resulting in body burdens of <0.5mg/kg body weight is not likely to give rise to detectable neurological signs in adults. This intake corresponds to blood values of <200μg/L and mercury levels in the hair of <50mg/kg. However, this level of MeHg exposure in pregnant women may result in inhibited brain development of the fetus, with psychomotor retardation of the child. This effect also appears to be reduced by the intake of PUFAs through fish consumption. The highest level of MeHg load in pregnant women that is not associated with inhibition of fetal brain development is not known. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that genetic polymorphisms can modify mercury metabolism and susceptibility to mercury exposure. Specific genotypes have been associated with increased susceptibility to mercury exposure in humans.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"539-599","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Chelatingtherapy","Ethylmercury","Genetic polymorphism","Mercuric mercury","Mercury vapor","Metabolism","Methylmercury","Neurodevelopment","Toxicity"]},{"key":"S2B6W4C6","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Emwas","lastName":"Abdul-Hamid"},{"firstName":"Szczepski","lastName":" Kacper"},{"firstName":"Poulson","lastName":" Benjamin Gabriel"},{"firstName":"McKay","lastName":" Ryan"},{"firstName":"Tenori","lastName":" Leonardo"},{"firstName":"Saccenti","lastName":" Edoardo"},{"firstName":"Lachowicz","lastName":" Joanna"},{"firstName":"Jaremko","lastName":" Mariusz"}],"title":"Chapter 5 - Nuclear magnetic resonance in metabolomics","publication_title":"Metabolomics Perspectives","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323850629000052","abstract_note":"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the most common and powerful techniques used in metabolomics.

All sea-based water storages can be called as coastal reservoirs, while land-based reservoirs are termed as dams that can be divided into eastern/western dams. The western dam generally is perpendicular to the incoming flow, but eastern dam is parallel to the incoming flow. Our crisis is caused by too much, too little, too turbid, and too dirty water. Currently about 70% of world's population do not have sufficient water for at least one month, which cannot be solved by overdevelopment of groundwater, more dam construction, desalination or wastewater recycling (newater) plants. Only coastal reservoir technology has the potential to solve the water crisis as only it is a sustainable and nature-based solution for water and can make every drop count.

In the same instance, organic farming endorses the use of natural food, animal welfare, avoidance of waste, and product diversity. In terms of climate change and environmental effects, organic farming causes less pollution than traditional farming. Organic farming presently accounts for 1% of agricultural land worldwide, which yielding is lower on average. Due to good knowledge requirements and yield gaps, observation might further increase the larger number of farmers to switch to organic practices. Upscaling of organic agriculture may cause additional loss to natural habitats and demand output cost increases, making foodstuff less prohibitive for poor customers in developing countries.

A key challenge is to provide accurate predictions of PV power output since this will assist grid operators for efficient capacity management and scheduling. In this paper, a data-driven method was developed, using time-series of PV power output from a PV station in Limassol, Cyprus to estimate the clear-sky PV electricity production without any exogenous data. The time-series was divided into monthly intervals and analysed by using the mean value, the maximum value and the standard deviation. The predicted clear-sky PV signals calculated were compared to the best visibly smooth signal in terms of Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Mean Absolute Percent Error.

The present study evaluated the role of geoclimatic factors in the geochemistry of mangrove soils by using wet extractions and several physical and chemical parameters. Soil samples were collected in 11 mangrove forests from NE (n = 94) and SE Brazil (n = 230). Our results show an important effect of the surrounding geology and climate on the geochemistry of the mangrove soils. NE mangroves are dominated by suboxic soils (mean: Eh of +150 ± 174 mV and pH 7.1 ± 0.5, respectively) while anoxic conditions prevail in the SE mangrove soils (mean: Eh −46 ± 251 mV and pH 6.5 ± 0.5). In the NE region, a period of several months without rainfall and high temperatures leads to soil suboxic conditions. Conversely, at the SE coast, the surrounding mountain range contributes to well-distributed rain favoring anoxic conditions. The contrasting geochemical environment caused differences in the geochemistry of elements such as C, Fe, and S. Significantly higher Fe (193 ± 24 μmol g−1) and organic carbon contents (6.9 ± 7.1%) were recorded in the SE coast. The higher organic carbon contents are possibly related to Fe organo-mineral associations. These differences are ultimately associated with the contrasting geological surroundings (crystalline massifs at the SE and the iron poor sedimentary formations at the NE). The higher contents of reactive Fe and organic carbon also triggered more intense pyritization in the SE mangroves (pyritic Fe: 93 ± 63 μmol g−1). Our results demonstrate that climate and geological surroundings create identifiable patterns at a regional level and, thus, studies should take these factors into account on future global modelling approaches.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"152152","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Contrastingclimate","Geoclimatic regions","Geological surroundings","Iron geochemistry","Tropical coast"]},{"key":"SAEQAMVH","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Chung","lastName":"Soh-Myung"},{"firstName":"Jeon","lastName":" Gyu-Mok"},{"firstName":"Park","lastName":" Jong-Chun"}],"title":"Numerical approach to analyze fluid flow in a type C tank for liquefied hydrogen carrier (part 1: Sloshing flow)","publication_title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","issn":"0360-3199","doi":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.156","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319921045444","abstract_note":"The demand for clean energy use has been increasing worldwide, and hydrogen has attracted attention as an alternative energy source.

The sloshing impact pressure inside of the tank was measured via simulation and subjected to statistical analysis. In addition, the influence of sloshing flow on the appendages installed inside of the type C tank (stiffened ring and swash bulkhead) was quantitatively evaluated. In particular, the influence of the sloshing flow inside of the type C tank on the appendages can be utilized as an important indicator at the design stage. Furthermore, if such sloshing impact forces are repeatedly experienced over an extended period of time under cryogenic conditions, the behavior of the tank and appendages must be analyzed in terms of fatigue and brittle failure to ensure the safety of the transportation operation.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"5609-5626","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Cryogenicliquid","Gas-liquid density ratio","Liquid hydrogen","Liquified hydrogen transportation","Sloshing flow","Type C tank"]},{"key":"EBM3LWIC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":""}],"title":"Abstracts","publication_title":"Fuel and Energy Abstracts","issn":"0140-6701","doi":"10.1016/j.fueleneab.2021.12.002","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140670121000424","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"2-110","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"LA35VYSG","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Burbano-Girón","lastName":"Jaime"},{"firstName":"Jantke","lastName":" Kerstin"},{"firstName":"Molina-Berbeo","lastName":" Maria Alejandra"},{"firstName":"Buriticá-Mejía","lastName":" Natalia"},{"firstName":"Urbina-Cardona","lastName":" J.

We present a comprehensive spatial conservation approach for Neotropical biodiversity by including surrogates for three biodiversity attributes: composition (8563 species), structure (663 ecosystems), and function (5382 ecological groups). We evaluated the differences in the representativeness and surrogacy-level of resulting portfolios for each attribute, considering the differences for current established conservation areas (CAs), prioritized areas (PRAs; those selected to complement the CAs), and total areas (TAs: CAs + PRAs). The assessment included the entire Neotropics, and a regionalization approach using the Global 200 Ecoregions by country. Finally, we identified critical areas for conservation based on the coincidence of irreplaceable PRAs among biodiversity attributes. Our results confirm the premise that no single surrogate represents biodiversity comprehensively, providing quantitative evidence to support the importance of using integrative information of surrogates for different levels of biodiversity into identifying priority areas for conservation. The spatial mismatch in the portfolios of areas shows how the use of a single level of biodiversity would lead to the omission of conservation priorities for other levels. We also identified critical areas for conservation where irreplaceable spatial priorities of the different biodiversity attributes matched. These areas coincided with known critical and threatened global biodiversity hotspots, and are mostly located in the Chaco, the Atlantic Forest, the Pantanal, Cerrado, and Caatinga regions, and the moist and dry forests of the northern Andes and Mesoamerica.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"109421","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Effectiveness","Comprehensiveness","Conservation planning","Representativeness","Surrogacy"]},{"key":"ICEDJ53H","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Calle-Rendón","lastName":"Bayron R."},{"firstName":"de Toledo","lastName":" José Julio"},{"firstName":"Mustin","lastName":" Karen"},{"firstName":"Vasconcelos","lastName":" Ivan M."},{"firstName":"Hilário","lastName":" Renato R."}],"title":"Priority areas for conservation of primates in a threatened Amazonian savanna","publication_title":"Journal for Nature Conservation","issn":"1617-1381","doi":"10.1016/j.jnc.2021.126109","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1617138121001564","abstract_note":"Primates are globally recognized as an important component of biodiversity, however, more than half of primate species in the world are threatened and agriculture expansion is one of the main threats. Brazil has one of the largest networks of protected areas (PAs) in the world, but there are some conservation gaps, such as the Amazonian savannas. We aim to identify a network of priority areas to conserve a Brazilian Amazonian savanna highly threatened by agriculture expansion, by using seven primate species and four vegetation types as targets. We constructed species distribution models (SDMs) for the primates and used a Systematic Conservation Planning approach. We defined as a quantitative conservation target the proportion of the distribution of each primate species within the network according to traits related to their vulnerability to extinction. In addition, we set a target of including at least 30% of each savanna type within priority areas. We created a map of potential use of the land for agriculture and another of environmental risk, which were included as costs in the decision process, and together with the SDMs and vegetation types, identified the network of priority areas by using the software Marxan. We evaluated the feasibility of implementing conservation actions, such as establishing Conservation Units (e.g. reserves managed by the government), or implementing community-based conservation actions in each priority area. Additionally, we estimated the economic investment (US$/year) required to establish Conservation Units across the priority areas. Conservation targets for primates and vegetation types were met by protecting 3,240 km2 of the Savannas of Amapá. An investment of approximately US$958,122/year over five years is required to turn these priority areas into Conservation Units, however, we propose other strategies such as conservation on community lands and public policies. All these strategies would allow for protecting forest cover and the heterogeneous environments that are suitable for primates and other biodiversity components.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"126109","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Protectedareas","Brazil","Amapá","Community lands","Systematic conservation planning"]},{"key":"KVDVFUSZ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Nadaleti","lastName":"Willian Cézar"},{"firstName":"de Souza","lastName":" Eduarda Gomes"},{"firstName":"Lourenço","lastName":" Vitor Alves"}],"title":"Green hydrogen-based pathways and alternatives: Towards the renewable energy transition in South America's regions–Part B","publication_title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","issn":"0360-3199","doi":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.113","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036031992101867X","abstract_note":"Hydropower compounds most of the energy matrix of the countries of the Latin America and Caribbean region (LAC). Considering the concern in reducing Green House Gases emissions (GHG) from hydropower plants and hydrogen production from fossil sources, green hydrogen (H2) appears as an energy vector able to mitigate this impact. Improving the efficiency of the plant and producing renewable energy the element is an interesting alternative from the ecological and economic point of view. This study aims to estimate the potential of H2 production from wasted energy, through the electrolysis of water in hydroelectric plants in Colombia and Venezuela. The construction of two scenarios allowed obtaining a difference, considering a spilled flow of 2/3 in the first scenario and 1/3 in the second. In Colombia, hydrogen production reached 3.39 E+08 Nm3 at a cost of 2.05 E+05 USD/kWh in scenario1, and 1.70 E+08 Nm3 costing 4.10 E+05 USD/kWh in scenario 2. Regarding the Venezuelan context, the country obtained lower production values of H2, ranging between 7.76 E+07 Nm3.d−1 and 4.31 E+07 Nm3.d−1, and production cost between 9.45 E+09 USD/kWh and 1.89 E+10 USD/kWh. Thus, the final cost for the production and storage of H2 was estimated at 0.2239 USD.kg−1. Ultimately, Colombia and Venezuela have a large potential to supply the demand for nitrogen fertilizers with green ammonia production, apply green hydrogen in manufacturing and use the surplus for energy substitution of Liquefied Petroleum Gas - LPG. In Colombia, the chemical energy offered is equivalent to 6.681 E+11 MJ/year−1 and in Venezuela, the result is equal to 1.697 E+11 MJ/year−1 in the conservative scenario. Finally, the countries have great potential for the diversification of the energy matrix and the insertion of renewables in the system.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"1-15","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Hydropower","Electrolysis","Green ammonia","LGP","Nitrogen fertilizers","Wasted energy"]},{"key":"EBSFW4P4","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Hussain","lastName":"S.

To build confidence for spatially distributed simulations, model transferability, i.e. the ability of the same model to provide reliable predictions at contrasting sites, has to be thoroughly tested. We tested the transferability of a spatially explicit forest IBM, TROLL, with a trait-based species parameterization and global gridded climate forcing, by applying it to two sites with sharply contrasting climate and floristic compositions across the tropics, one in South America and one in Southeast Asia. We identified which parameters are most influential for model calibration and assessed the model sensitivity to climatic conditions for a given calibration. TROLL produced realistic predictions of forest structure and dynamics at both sites and this necessitates the recalibration of only three parameters, namely photosynthesis efficiency, crown allometry and mortality rate. All three relate to key processes that constrain model transferability and warrant further model development and data acquisition, with mortality being a particular priority of improvement for the current generation of vegetation models. Varying the climatic conditions at both sites demonstrate similar, and expected, model responses: GPP increased with temperature and irradiance, while stem density and aboveground biomass declined as temperature increased. The climate dependence of productivity and biomass was mediated by plant respiration, carbon allocation and mortality, which has implications both on model development and on forecasting of future carbon dynamics. Our detailed examination of forest IBM transferability unveils key processes that need to improve in genericity before reliable large-scale implementations can be envisioned.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"109801","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazonia","Forest simulations","Climate forcing","Model calibration","Taiwan","TROLL"]},{"key":"H8BPE7VB","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Leicheng"},{"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":" Chunyan"},{"firstName":"Xie","lastName":" Weiming"},{"firstName":"Xu","lastName":" Fan"},{"firstName":"Wu","lastName":" Hui"},{"firstName":"Wan","lastName":" Yuanyang"},{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":" Zhanghua"},{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":" Weiguo"},{"firstName":"Shen","lastName":" Jian"},{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":" Zheng Bing"},{"firstName":"He","lastName":" Qing"}],"title":"Changjiang Delta in the Anthropocene: Multi-scale hydro-morphodynamics and management challenges","publication_title":"Earth-Science Reviews","issn":"0012-8252","doi":"10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103850","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825221003512","abstract_note":"The Changjiang Delta (CD) is one of well-studied large deltas of critical socio-economical and ecological importance regionally and global representativeness. Cumulated field data and numerical modeling has facilitated scientific understanding of its hydro-morphodynamics at multiple spatial and time scales, but the changing boundary forcing conditions and increasing anthropogenic influences pose management challenges requiring integrated knowledge. Here we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the multi-scale deltaic hydro-morphodynamics, discuss their relevance and management perspectives in a global context, and identify knowledge gaps for future study. The CD is classified as a river-tide mixed-energy, muddy and highly turbid, fluvio-deltaic composite system involving large-scale land-ocean interacted processes. Its hydro-morphodynamic evolution exhibits profound temporal variations at the fortnightly, seasonal, and inter-annual time scales, and strong spatial variability between tidal river and tidal estuary, and between different distributary channels. As the river-borne sediment has declined >70%, the deltaic morphodynamic adaptation lags behind sediment decline because sediment redistribution within the delta emerges to play a role in sustaining tidal flat accretion. However, the deltaic channels have become narrower, deepened and growingly constrained under cumulated human activities, e.g., extensive embankment and construction of jetties and groins, possibly initiating a decrease in morphodynamic activities and sediment trapping efficiency. Overall, the CD undergoes transitions from net sedimentation and naturally slow morphodynamic adaptation to erosion and human-driven radical adjustment. A shift in management priority from delta development to ecosystem conservation provides an opportunity for restoring the resilience to flooding and erosion hazards. The lessons and identified knowledge gaps inform study and management of worldwide estuaries and deltas undergoing intensified human interferences.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"103850","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Delta","Sediment","Changjiang","Human activities","Morphology","Tide"]},{"key":"9LT496D4","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Flach","lastName":"Leonardo"},{"firstName":"Van Bressem","lastName":" Marie-Françoise"},{"firstName":"Pitombo","lastName":" Fabio"},{"firstName":"Aznar","lastName":" Francisco J."}],"title":"Emergence of the epibiotic barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis in Guiana dolphins after a morbillivirus outbreak in Sepetiba Bay, Brazil","publication_title":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","issn":"0272-7714","doi":"10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107632","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771421004819","abstract_note":"We report on the emergence of the epibiotic barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis in Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) from Sepetiba Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in September 2018, six months after a lethal morbillivirus epidemic. Small boat surveys were conducted at the entrance and in the interior of the bay from January 2018 to February 2021. Dolphins were photo-identified and classified according to overall spatial use of the Bay. We examined the potential influence of the period and habitat on the prevalence of X. globicipitis. The overall prevalence of the barnacle was 38.7% in 214 dolphins. X. globicipitis was not observed in 99 individually identified dolphins from January to August 2018 (first period) but was seen on 83 of the 194 (42.8%) dolphins photographed from September 2018 to February 2021 (second period). Moreover, in 22 individuals repeatedly photographed during both periods, prevalence was 0% and 91% during the first and second period, respectively. Prevalence was the highest in the dolphins using the entrance of the Bay (55.0%, N = 140), intermediate in animals using equally both the entrance and interior area (42.9%, N = 47), and the lowest (6.4%, N = 7) in those using the interior area only. The calves of five females infested with X. globicipitis were free of barnacles. Based on repeated photographs of barnacles at different growth stage on six dolphins, the periods between first and last sight with the epibiont were (in increasing order) 29, 32, 40, 51, 68 and 78 days. A conservative estimation from the initial settlement to sexual maturity was around 40–45 days. Three individuals of X. globicipitis collected on a stranded dolphin measured 65 mm, 61 mm and 35 mm, the largest recorded size to date. The two large individuals had incubated embryos while the smaller one presented developing gonads. Poor health and an impaired immune response in the dolphins that had survived the morbillivirus epidemic may have favored the introduction of the barnacle, but biotic and abiotic factors could also had played an important role. This paper documents the colonization of an estuarine area by X. globicipitis following ecological changes.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"107632","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Brazil","Epidemiology","Emerging disease","Epizoite","Morbillivirus"]},{"key":"C2NKFCA5","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Rodríguez-Morales","lastName":"Alfonso J."},{"firstName":"Bonilla-Aldana","lastName":" D.

The Fundão Dam collapse caused massive damage to the marine environment on the Southern Atlantic and Brazilian coast, reaching various kilometers from its origin, becoming a source of contamination. Along this Brazilian coast are vast mangrove areas with high biodiversity, different geomorphology, and distinct ecological functioning. These mangroves support fisheries' productivity in the Tropical South Atlantic, in connection with Abrolhos Reef. Brazil does not have a protocol to monitor environmental damage in this ecosystem, and we proposed to develop a way to identify the impact and quantify it. Along the estuaries, to assess the damage, the plots were demarked in three regions: the upper, middle, and lower estuary, and in both types of forest: fridge and basin. Samples of sediment and leaves were collected bi-monthly to evaluate metal concentrations, especially iron and manganese, the most abundant metals in Fundão Dam. The monitoring also evaluated the forest structure, dynamics of the crabs' population, and flora productivity. First-year monitoring identifies a high concentration of iron or manganese in the sediment above the NOAAs' recommendation in all the estuaries. The concentration of Fe and Mn in sediment varies seasonally in magnitude, concentration, and types of metals between estuaries, sectors, and forests. The behavior of biological indicators in the presence of metals (type and concentration) differed between fauna and flora species. The monitoring recognized that the tailings mining from Fundão Dam impacted all estuaries by different magnitudes and persistence. These differences are due to geomorphology diversity, climate, and oceanographic influences.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"150452","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatevariability","Environmental settings","Invisible damage","Mangrove bioindicators"]},{"key":"B26D8HNK","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Fiard","lastName":"Maud"},{"firstName":"Cuny","lastName":" Philippe"},{"firstName":"Sylvi","lastName":" Léa"},{"firstName":"Hubas","lastName":" Cédric"},{"firstName":"Jézéquel","lastName":" Ronan"},{"firstName":"Lamy","lastName":" Dominique"},{"firstName":"Walcker","lastName":" Romain"},{"firstName":"El Houssainy","lastName":" Amonda"},{"firstName":"Heimbürger-Boavida","lastName":" Lars-Eric"},{"firstName":"Robinet","lastName":" Tony"},{"firstName":"Bihannic","lastName":" Isabelle"},{"firstName":"Gilbert","lastName":" Franck"},{"firstName":"Michaud","lastName":" Emma"},{"firstName":"Dirberg","lastName":" Guillaume"},{"firstName":"Militon","lastName":" Cécile"}],"title":"Mangrove microbiota along the urban-to-rural gradient of the Cayenne estuary (French Guiana, South America): Drivers and potential bioindicators","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150667","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721057454","abstract_note":"The microbial communities inhabiting the Atlantic-East Pacific (AEP) mangroves have been poorly studied, and mostly comprise chronically polluted mangroves.

The microbial communities were assigned into 50 phyla. Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes were the most abundant taxa. The environmental determinants found to significantly correlated to the microbial communities at these mangroves were granulometry, dieldrin concentration, pH, and total carbon (TC) content. Furthermore, a precise analysis of the sediment highlights the existence of three types of anthropogenic pressure among the stations: (i) organic matter (OM) enrichment due to the proximity to the city and its wastewater treatment plant, (ii) dieldrin contamination, and (iii) naphthalene contamination. These forms of weak anthropogenic pressure seemed to impact the bacterial population size and microbial assemblages. A decrease in Bathyarchaeota, “Candidatus Nitrosopumilus”, and Nitrospira genera was observed in mangroves subjected to OM enrichment. Mangroves polluted with organic contaminants were enriched in Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfarculaceae, and Acanthopleuribacteraceae (with dieldrin or polychlorobiphenyl contamination), and Chitinophagaceae and Geobacteraceae (with naphthalene contamination).

The results showed that biochar application had the most influence upon SOC stocks in the agricultural lands (25.38%) followed by conservation tillage (18.81%) and cover crop (15.8%). Medium term experiments (6–20 years) of these conservation practices showed about 31.00–96.15%improvement in SOC while the effects gradually diminished in long term experiments (>20 years). The combinations of these practices have been observed to have an evidently positive impact upon the SOC stocks in general. This work provides a systematic evaluation of all the widely performed CSA and other conservation practices and their effects on SOC dynamics under differing management settings.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"150428","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","CSA practices","Meta-analysis","SOC stocks","Tropics and subtropics"]},{"key":"AQLNF3JU","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2022","author":[{"firstName":"Rodríguez-García","lastName":"Martha del Pilar"},{"firstName":"Galindo-Manrique","lastName":" Alicia Fernanda"},{"firstName":"Cortez-Alejandro","lastName":" Klender Aimer"},{"firstName":"Méndez-Sáenz","lastName":" Alma Berenice"}],"title":"Eco-efficiency and financial performance in Latin American countries: An environmental intensity approach","publication_title":"Research in International Business and Finance","issn":"0275-5319","doi":"10.1016/j.ribaf.2021.101547","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0275531921001689","abstract_note":"This research contributes to the literature by empirically demonstrating the economic effect of listed companies’ eco-efficiency in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico through an environmental intensity approach.

We analyzed effects of experimental soil applications of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and N + P on soil BVOC exchanges (in particular of total terpenes, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes), to determine source and sink dynamics between seasons (dry and wet) and elevations (upper and lower elevations corresponding to top of the hills (30 m high) and bottom of the valley). We identified 45 soil terpenoids compounds emitted to the atmosphere, comprising 26 monoterpenes and 19 sesquiterpenes; of these, it was possible to identify 13 and 7 compounds, respectively. Under ambient conditions, soils acted as sinks of these BVOCs, with greatest soil uptake recorded for sesquiterpenes at upper elevations during the wet season (-282 μg m-2 h-1). Fertilization shifted soils from a sink to source, with greatest levels of terpene emissions recorded at upper elevations during the wet season, following the addition of N (monoterpenes: 406 μg m-2 h-1) and P (sesquiterpenes: 210 μg m-2 h-1). Total soil terpene emission rates were negatively correlated with total atmospheric terpene concentrations.

Climate change may create unsuitable environmental conditions, forcing species to move to persist. However, land-use changes create barriers that limit the access of some species to future available habitats. Here, we project the impacts of climate and land-use change on 228 Neotropical bat species by forecasting changes in environmental suitability, while accounting for the effect of habitat type specialization and simulating dispersal across suitable patches. We also identify the most vulnerable ecoregions and those that may offer future stable refugia. We further investigate potential functional changes by analysing the response of different trophic guilds. We found that the range contraction of habitat specialists, especially frugivores, was more frequent and stronger under all simulated scenarios. Projected changes differ markedly across ecoregions. While the Amazon region is likely to undergo high turnover rates in bat composition, the Andean grassland, Cerrado and Chaco might experience the greatest losses. The expansion of habitat generalists, which forage in open areas and commonly establish large colonies in manmade structures, coupled with the range contraction of habitat specialists is projected to homogenize bat communities across the Neotropics. Overall, dispersal will likely be the key for the future of Neotropical bat diversity. Therefore, safeguarding the refugia highlighted here, by expanding and connecting the existing network of protected areas, for example, may allow species to move in response to global change.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"454-463","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Chiroptera","Dispersal","Biodiversity re-distribution","Climate change refugia","Functional homogenization","Landscape connectivity","Megadiverse regions","Upward and upslope shifts"]},{"key":"FRWBMUK5","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Jagadesh","lastName":"Soushieta"},{"firstName":"Combe","lastName":" Marine"},{"firstName":"Ginouvès","lastName":" Marine"},{"firstName":"Simon","lastName":" Stéphane"},{"firstName":"Prévot","lastName":" Ghislaine"},{"firstName":"Couppié","lastName":" Pierre"},{"firstName":"Nacher","lastName":" Mathieu"},{"firstName":"Gozlan","lastName":" Rodolphe Elie"}],"title":"Spatial variations in Leishmaniasis: A biogeographic approach to mapping the distribution of Leishmania species","publication_title":"One Health","issn":"2352-7714","doi":"10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100307","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771421000975","abstract_note":"Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is the most prevalent form of Leishmaniasis and is widely endemic in the Americas.

Improved practices, such as reduced-impact logging (RIL), and alternative timber production strategies (e.g. plantations) can drastically change the overall carbon impact of the wood production sector. Assessing the carbon balance of timber production is crucial but highly dependent on methodological approaches, especially regarding system boundaries and temporality. We developed a temporally-explicit and territory scale model of carbon balance calibrated with long-term local data using Bayesian inference. The model accounts for carbon fluxes from selective logging in natural forest, timber plantation, first transformation and avoided emissions through energy substitution. We used it to compare prospective scenarios of development for the wood sector in French Guiana. Results show that intensification of practices, through increased logging intensity conducted with RIL and establishment of timber plantations, are promising development strategies to reduce the carbon emissions of the French-Guianese wood sector, as well as the area needed for wood production and hence the pressure on natural forests. By reducing logging damage by nearly 50%, RIL allows increasing logging intensity in natural forest from 20 m3 ha−1 to 30 m3 ha−1 without affecting the carbon balance. The use of logging byproducts as fuelwood also improved the carbon balance of selective logging, when substituted to fossil fuel. Allocating less than 30000 ha to plantation would allow producing 200000 m3 of timber annually, while the same production in natural forest would imply logging more than 400000 ha over 60 years. Timber plantation should be preferentially established on non-forested lands, as converting natural forests to plantation leads to high carbon emission peak over the first three decades. We recommend a mixed-strategy combining selective logging in natural forests and plantations as a way to improve long-term carbon balance while reducing short-term emissions. This strategy can reduce the pressure on natural forests while mitigating the risks of changing practices and allowing a diversified source of timber for a diversity of uses. It requires adaptation of the wood sector and development of technical guidelines. Research and monitoring efforts are also needed to assess the impacts of changing practices on other ecosystem services, especially biodiversity conservation.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"119532","language":"en","automatic_tags":["FrenchGuiana","Reduced-impact logging","Selective logging","Bayesian modelling","Land-sparing strategy","Timber plantation"]},{"key":"DBYKN2ZE","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Singh","lastName":"Ashutosh Kumar"},{"firstName":"Liu","lastName":" Wenjie"},{"firstName":"Zakari","lastName":" Sissou"},{"firstName":"Wu","lastName":" Junen"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":" Bin"},{"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":" Xiao Jin"},{"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":" Xiai"},{"firstName":"Zou","lastName":" Xin"},{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":" Wanjun"},{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":" Chunfeng"},{"firstName":"Singh","lastName":" Rishikesh"},{"firstName":"Nath","lastName":" Arun Jyoti"}],"title":"A global review of rubber plantations: Impacts on ecosystem functions, mitigations, future directions, and policies for sustainable cultivation","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148948","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721040201","abstract_note":"The growing global need for latex is driving rubber plantation (RP) expansion since the last century, with >2 Mha of cultivation area being established in the last decade.

Although rubber cultivation has improved the economic status of farmers, it has altered the habitat's ecology and ecosystem functions (EF). However, studies on the impacts of RP on EF are limited, and a clear overview is not available. To bridge this gap, we conducted an inclusive review of the EF of RP, including soil carbon storage, aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB), litter production and decomposition, respiration, and biodiversity (plants, animals, soil fauna, and microbes). We compared the EF in RP (monoculture) with those in forests because the conversion of forests to RP is prevalent in the tropics and because most RP studies used forests as reference ecosystems. We found RP generally have lower EF than forests. The impacts of RP on some EF are more severe (e.g., AGB, BGB, and plant diversity), causing decreases of >55%, and the effects are consistently negative irrespective of plantation age. However, including agroforestry or polyculture, integrated pest management, cover cropping, mulching, and composting can improve the EF in RP to some extent. We highlighted research gaps, particularly substantial research gaps concerning the influence of plant diversity treatments (i.e., agroforestry) performed in RP on EF. Additionally, more empirical data on the significance of spatial and temporal levels are required, such as how the impact on EF could vary with climate and RP age, as we showed some examples where EF differs spatially and temporally. More importantly, further research on plantation management to offset EF losses is needed. Finally, we emphasized knowledge gaps and suggested future directions and policies for improving EF in RP.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"148948","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biodiversity","Carbon storage","Ecosystem functions and services","Litter decomposition","Rubber-based agroforestry","Sustainable cropping"]},{"key":"4AC7KD6K","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Prairie","lastName":"Yves T."},{"firstName":"Mercier-Blais","lastName":" Sara"},{"firstName":"Harrison","lastName":" John A."},{"firstName":"Soued","lastName":" Cynthia"},{"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":" Paul del"},{"firstName":"Harby","lastName":" Atle"},{"firstName":"Alm","lastName":" Jukka"},{"firstName":"Chanudet","lastName":" Vincent"},{"firstName":"Nahas","lastName":" Roy"}],"title":"A new modelling framework to assess biogenic GHG emissions from reservoirs: The G-res tool","publication_title":"Environmental Modelling & Software","issn":"1364-8152","doi":"10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105117","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815221001602","abstract_note":"Human-made reservoirs are now recognized as potentially significant sources of greenhouse gases, comparable to other anthropogenic sources, yet efforts to estimate these reservoir emissions have been hampered by the complexity of the underlying processes and a lack of coherent budgeting approaches.

The research on the financial risk of mining enterprises focuses more on how to adjust R&D activities, environmental performance to improve the financial performance of enterprises. There is still a lot of room for in-depth research on the systematic prevention and early warning of financial risks of listed mining companies. At the same time, in terms of research methods, many scholars used multivariate discriminant model, logistic regression model and support vector machine model.

The research conclusions of this paper are as follows: (1) The BP neural network financial early warning model constructed in this paper has high prediction accuracy, which can be well used in the practice of financial early warning of mining listed companies; (2) The financial situation of China's A-share mining listed companies in 2018 is generally in a good state. The companies with good financial status can effectively control the cost and have good debt paying ability while earning income; (3) For companies with financial status that require early warning, the root cause is mainly that they do not pay attention to the risk of bad debt losses, which makes current credit sales income and accounts receivable are at high levels, and they also do not have good profitability.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"102223","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Back-propagation(BP) neural network","Financial early warning","Mining listed companies"]},{"key":"S3N9VU8K","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Khalidov","lastName":"Ibragim"},{"firstName":"Milovidov","lastName":" Konstantin"},{"firstName":"Soltakhanov","lastName":" Anzor"}],"title":"Decommissioning of oil and gas assets: industrial and environmental security management, international experience and Russian practice","publication_title":"Heliyon","issn":"2405-8440","doi":"10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07646","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021017497","abstract_note":"In the Russian oil and gas industry, there are still no technical regulations for unified rules and standards governing the establishment of the abandonment fund and the decommissioning of fields.

Apart from a review of the latest literature, an international survey was performed to design a model using principal component analysis to identify the main descriptors of sustainability initiatives among Latin American HEIs and also the major drivers and challenges. The study sheds some light on the ways universities perceive and handle sustainability-related initiatives. The results show that sustainability is being incorporated in more than 80% of the sampled universities, and that a special emphasis is being given to campus operations. The value of the paper resides on the fact that it one of the few papers that have holistically investigated trends in sustainable development across universities in Latin America. The implications of the study are twofold. It maps for the first time how sustainable development initiatives are being practiced in 157 universities in 13 countries, being one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind, and it also outlines some of the main challenges that universities in the region face.

While this contributes to a reduction of pressure on domestic ecosystems in some regions, spillover effects from these processes represent potential obstacles for global sustainable land-use. This contribution scrutinizes the complex global resource nexus of national land-use intensity, international trade of biomass goods, and resource footprints in land-use systems. Via a systematic account of the global human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) and input–output modelling, we demonstrate that with growing income countries reduce their reliance on local renewable resources, while simultaneously consuming more biomass goods produced in other countries requiring higher energy and material inputs. The characteristic 'outsourcing' country appropriates 43% of its domestic net primary production, but net-imports a similar amount (64 gigajoules per capita and year) from other countries and requires energy (11 GJ/cap/yr) and material (~400 kg/cap/yr) inputs four to five times higher as the majority of the global population to sustain domestic land-use intensification. This growing societal disconnect from domestic ecological productivity enables a domestic conservation of ecosystems while satisfying growing demand. However, it does not imply a global decoupling of biomass consumption from resource and land requirements.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:46:45","pages":"102311","language":"en","automatic_tags":["embodiedHANPP","Environmentally-extended multi-regional input–output analysis","International trade","Land-use","Resource nexus","Teleconnections"]},{"key":"V7KRHHI2","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Pillot","lastName":"Benjamin"},{"firstName":"Al-Kurdi","lastName":" Nadeem"},{"firstName":"Gervet","lastName":" Carmen"},{"firstName":"Linguet","lastName":" Laurent"}],"title":"Optimizing operational costs and PV production at utility scale: An optical fiber network analogy for solar park clustering","publication_title":"Applied Energy","issn":"0306-2619","doi":"10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117158","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921005912","abstract_note":"Increasing the share of renewable energy sources in power systems is key to a successful energy transition. Optimal renewable site selection requires a holistic approach, involving land, resources, environmental and economical data and constraints. In this paper we consider the problem of solar PV penetration into the power network as a spatiotemporal analysis combined with decision support targeted for policy makers and investors. Our goal is to seek new models that maximize energy penetration and stability into the network, while minimizing the operational costs. We show how the selection of solar PV sites can be accomplished to satisfy such objectives by investigating the optimal clustering of multiple solar PV parks around a shared electrical substation. This is a combinatorial problem in terms of all the potential clusters given the set of PV site candidates. Our main contribution lies in identifying and proposing a modeling analogy of our problem with the so-called SONET problem, tackled in fiber network designs. We show how this new spatiotemporal PV park placement model minimizes operational costs, while increasing energy stability of the solutions produced. We also introduce a GIS preprocessing step to reduce the computational cost of the proposed approach. We compare our proposed SONET-based model to an existing GIS-optimization model on a real case study and data from the French Guiana’s power system. This new approach aggregates multiple PV parks into clusters distributed across the territory. In the case of French Guiana, the same global nominal power (≈45MW) can, for instance, be distributed among 11 PV parks and 3 clusters, against 3 large-scale PV parks. Results show substantial gain in costs per kWh produced, up to 10MW of extra installed power and 16GWh of extra power generation when considering PV parks ⩽5MW. The new cluster configuration also ensures improved energy stability of the solutions, resulting in mitigation of the risks for both the network manager and the decision maker.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"117158","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Energyplanning","Solar PV","SONET","Spatial decision support","Spatiotemporal data"]},{"key":"PNIA8FIV","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"You-Shao"},{"firstName":"Gu","lastName":" Ji-Dong"}],"title":"Ecological responses, adaptation and mechanisms of mangrove wetland ecosystem to global climate change and anthropogenic activities","publication_title":"International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation","issn":"0964-8305","doi":"10.1016/j.ibiod.2021.105248","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964830521000780","abstract_note":"Mangrove wetlands possess four important characteristics as one of the unique marine ecosystems, and are found in the intertidal coastal regions of the tropics and subtropics in the world, mainly between latitudes 25° N and 25° S. The total area of the global mangrove forest is about 1.7 million hectares, spanning over 118 countries and territories. Mangroves play an important ecological role and functioning as a tropical coastal ecosystem with a total net primary productivity as high as 2000 g C·m−2·a−1. Mangrove ecosystems serve a key role in the maintenance and protection for tropical and subtropical marine biodiversity and a very important function in the global biogeochemical processes and climate change. Mangrove wetlands, situated between the terrestrial land and the oceans, are sensitive ecosystems not only to the physical environmental changes also to anthropogenic processes from urbanization and economic development. A rich diversity and communities of flora, fauna, and microorganisms is associated with the mangrove ecosystems and they include both visible organisms and non-visible ones of fungi, bacteria and archaea. These microorganisms play an important ecological role and function in the cycling of nutrients. Mangroves are typical marine ecosystems that are closely associated with the global climate change and can play a positive role. The survival and distribution of mangroves, to serve as an important ecological barrier along the coast, have also been affected by anthropogenic activities and global climate change. The present article reviews the impacts for global climate change on mangroves in terms of global warming, sea-level rising, atmospheric CO2 concentration increasing and extreme weather. It also touches onto the important microbial geochemical processes that are linked to climate change. Archaea are also given attention due to the recent findings on their ubiquity in mangrove and their potential ecological function. The global climate change will bring great challenges and opportunities to research, maintain and development of mangroves in the future.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"105248","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mangroves","Anthropogenic activities","Global climate change","Marine ecosystem","Opportunity and challenge","Responses and adaptation"]},{"key":"HETALTMR","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Bowman","lastName":"Kerry W"},{"firstName":"Dale","lastName":" Samuel A"},{"firstName":"Dhanani","lastName":" Sumana"},{"firstName":"Nehru","lastName":" Jevithen"},{"firstName":"Rabishaw","lastName":" Benjamin T"}],"title":"Environmental degradation of indigenous protected areas of the Amazon as a slow onset event","publication_title":"Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability","issn":"1877-3435","doi":"10.1016/j.cosust.2021.04.012","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343521000695","abstract_note":"The Amazon is the most concentrated expression of life on Earth and it is clearly threatened.

The exploitation of fish resources is expected to increase along with the growing human population, with underlying conservation issues in regions with high biodiversity value. The small fishery of the Maroni River, French Guiana, is a hotspot of biodiversity and endemism where resource depletion is suspected. We surveyed 754 boat landings in seven villages located in the upper half of the watershed, representing > 6300 fish during the study period (November 2013 - September 2014). Fishers used canoes with outboard engines almost exclusively (75 %) and fished within 32 km of their villages. Most fish were caught in trammel nets (81 %); the 20 most-landed species represented more than 87 % of catches. Depending on the village, daily catches and biomass averaged 6–14 fish and 1.7−13 kg per boat landing, respectively. Seven control sites located outside of the fishing grounds were fished to identify potential differences in catch per unit effort and fish size. Per 100 m2 of trammel net, mean catches ranged from 4 to 13 and 8–29 fish in the villages and control sites, respectively, while fish biomass ranged from 0.9 to 4 and 3.2−7 kg in villages and control sites, respectively. For all species combined, fish caught at control sites were bigger than those landed in villages. This difference was significant for nine of the most-landed species. Differences in fishing techniques and fish catches between villages illustrated the gradual disappearance of the ancestral subsistence fishing. Our results support indications that the fish community in the upper Maroni River is harvested intensively, address the issue of sustainability of the fishery there, and call attention to the need to conserve the river’s remarkable biodiversity.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"105995","language":"en","automatic_tags":["FrenchGuiana","Catch per unit effort","Fish size","Inland fishery survey","Resource decrease"]},{"key":"3GQBYCEK","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yifei"},{"firstName":"Lyu","lastName":" Min"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":" Ping"},{"firstName":"Lai","lastName":" Derrick Y.

Reconstructing the timing of surface uplift for each of the different Andean regions is of crucial importance for our understanding of continental-scale moisture transport and atmospheric circulation, the origin and evolution of the Amazon River and Rainforest, and ultimately, the origin and evolution of species on the world most biodiverse continent. Here, I present (1) a compilation of estimates of paleoelevation for 36 geomorphological domains of the Andes from the literature, and (2) a paleoelevation reconstruction of the Andes since 80 Ma. In the northern Andes, uplift started in the Late Cretaceous (~70 Ma) in the Western and Central Cordilleras of Ecuador, while the northwestern corner of the continent was still covered by shallow seas. Mountain building migrated progressively northwards, with the Perija Range and Santander Massif uplifting since the Oligocene and the Eastern Cordillera, Garzon Massif and Mérida Andes since the Miocene. In the central Andes, uplift migrated from west to east, whereby the main phase of uplift in the Western Cordillera took place during the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene, in the western Puna plateau during the Paleocene, in the eastern Puna plateau during the early-mid Miocene, and in the Altiplano and Eastern Cordillera during the mid-late Miocene. In the southern Patagonian Andes, significant elevation was already in place at 80 Ma and in western Patagonia, modern elevations were reached in the early Eocene. A second pulse of uplift and eastward migration of the orogenic front occurred during the early-mid Miocene. The reconstruction developed here is made available as a series of raster files, so that it can be used as input for a variety of studies in the solid Earth, climate, and biological sciences, thereby being a stepping stone on the path towards a better understanding of the coevolution of the solid Earth, landscapes, climate, and life in South America.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"103640","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Andes","Mountain building","Paleoaltimetry","Paleoelevation","Reconstruction"]},{"key":"PD7KC7FD","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Stefaner","lastName":"Katarina"},{"firstName":"Ghosh","lastName":" Subhadip"},{"firstName":"Mohd Yusof","lastName":" Mohamed Lokman"},{"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":" Hassan"},{"firstName":"Leitgeb","lastName":" Ernst"},{"firstName":"Schindlbacher","lastName":" Andreas"},{"firstName":"Kitzler","lastName":" Barbara"}],"title":"Soil greenhouse gas fluxes from a humid tropical forest and differently managed urban parkland in Singapore","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147305","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721023767","abstract_note":"Studies of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, CH4 and N2O) from tropical soils are still scarce and the effects of urban green space management on soil GHG fluxes are poorly addressed. In order to establish reliable global GHG budgets, field measurements of soil GHG fluxes from different land uses and management practices in tropical regions are urgently needed. In this study, soil fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured over a period of one year, from a forest and an urban parkland in Singapore. At the parkland site, two additional management practices were investigated, namely compost application to urban lawn and the replacement of lawn by legumes. The average CO2 efflux from the forest soil was 0.17 ± 0.01 g C m−2 h−1 and was 30% lower than that of the parkland soil. The forest soil was a CH4 sink (−36.03 ± 8.80 μg C m−2 h−1), while the parkland soil was a source of CH4 (43.79 ± 9.66 μg C m−2 h−1). Both soils were net emitters of N2O, with the forest soil releasing four times more N2O (23.23 ± 5.10 μg N m−2 h−1) than the parkland soil (6.47 ± 2.52 μg N m−2 h−1). During the entire observation period, compost application increased CO2eq by 30% compared with the untreated parkland soil. Shortly after compost addition, CO2 fluxes significantly increased and remained elevated until the end of the experiment. Soil CH4 emissions also increased, but the effect was small compared to CO2 (<1% CO2eq). Compost amendment caused an immediate short-term peak of N2O emissions. However, after the first day, which was characterized by a heavy rain event, the compost effect on N2O production was negligible. Compared to grass cultivation, legume planting resulted in a 20% reduction of CO2eq. This study shows that conserving mature secondary forests and the cultivation of herbaceous legumes on tropical urban soils, where open lawn spaces are not required, can reduce soil GHG emissions.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"147305","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Tropicalsoils","Compost","Legumes","Mature secondary forest","Soil GHG budget","Urban parkland"]},{"key":"QC3XMFDT","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Pang","lastName":"Ka-Lai"},{"firstName":"Hassett","lastName":" Brandon T."},{"firstName":"Shaumi","lastName":" Ami"},{"firstName":"Guo","lastName":" Sheng-Yu"},{"firstName":"Sakayaroj","lastName":" Jariya"},{"firstName":"Chiang","lastName":" Michael Wai-Lun"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":" Chien-Hui"},{"firstName":"Jones","lastName":" E.

The primary objective was to evaluate the influence of mariculture/aquaculture on the distribution characteristics of organic matter (OM), and preservation status of OC, TN, TP, and BSi in sediments. The average δ13C and δ15N values, and OC/TN ratios were −21.27‰, 6.74‰, and 8.90, respectively. Monte Carlo simulation results revealed that mariculture/aquaculture biodeposits accounted for >40% of the buried OM at sites where the breeding rafts and cages are located, whereas marine OM increased gradually to the open sea. Terrestrial OM was generally low accounting for 17% by average. The contents and distribution characteristics of biogenic elements were more influenced by mariculture/aquaculture and primary productivity than sediment textures. Lower OC/SSA (0.3–1.2 mg OC/m2), TN/SSA (~0.05–0.18 mg TN/m2), and TP/SSA (0.02–0.04 mg TP/m2) loadings indicated that increased sequestration of labile OM in a coastal bay could contribute to significant degradation of recalcitrant OM in sediments with significant loss of P relative to OC. Nitrogen contamination in surface sediments was due to increased injection of aquaculture biodeposits, and may pose a detrimental effect on the ecological sustainability of the bay. Higher BSi/SSA loadings (0.9–1.7 mg BSi/m2) revealed that BSi was more preserved, and that BSi-based proxy could be used for paleo-productivity studies. However, such preservation may induce adverse dissolved silicate limitation in a bay perturbed by eutrophication. Fine-grained sediments (clay and silt) accounted for >77% of the sediment texture types with higher SSA, and while controlling the contents of biogenic elements under given depositional conditions were not the main determining factors of OC, TN, TP, and BSi preservation.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"146899","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biogenicelements","Daya Bay","Influencing factors","Preservation status","Sedimentary organic matter"]},{"key":"V6K8SIRC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Shumlyanskyy","lastName":"Leonid"},{"firstName":"Ernst","lastName":" Richard E."},{"firstName":"Albekov","lastName":" Aleksander"},{"firstName":"Söderlund","lastName":" Ulf"},{"firstName":"Wilde","lastName":" Simon A."},{"firstName":"Bekker","lastName":" Andrey"}],"title":"The early Statherian (ca. 1800–1750 Ma) Prutivka-Novogol large igneous province of Sarmatia: Geochronology and implication for the Nuna/Columbia supercontinent reconstruction","publication_title":"Precambrian Research","issn":"0301-9268","doi":"10.1016/j.precamres.2021.106185","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301926821001133","abstract_note":"The Ukrainian Shield and Voronezh Crystalline Massif constitute the Sarmatian segment of Baltica. Here, only a few mafic-ultramafic dykes and layered intrusions have been dated, recording early Statherian (ca. 1800–1750 Ma) ages. We have determined new U-Pb baddeleyite ages for the Novogol sill (1789 ± 2 Ma) and the Gremyachye intrusion (1781 ± 7 Ma), which fall within the previously established age range of mafic magmatism in Sarmatia. Overall, mafic magmatism started at ca. 1800 Ma and reached a peak at ca. 1790 Ma. Several intrusions were emplaced between ca. 1785 and 1775 Ma. The next significant peak in magmatic activity took place at ca. 1760 Ma, although a few dykes are dated as late as ca. 1750. Together, these rocks constitute the Prutivka-Novogol large igneous province (LIP), with the main components consisting of tholeiitic dolerite, sub-alkaline olivine gabbro, high-Ti (picrite, camptonite) dykes, and kimberlite. Abundant anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite-granite (AMCG) magmatism also occurred throughout the Ukrainian Shield, coeval with tholeiitic magmatism. Early Statherian mafic magmatism was widespread in many parts of the Nuna/Columbia supercontinent, and magmatic barcoding demonstrates that the Sarmatia, Amazonia, São Francisco, West Africa, and North China cratons record similar events and were therefore probably in close proximity. This suggests that the Prutivka-Novogol LIP was part of a much larger superplume that affected an extensive area within the newly-formed supercontinent.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"106185","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Baltica","Early Statherian","Large igneous province","Mafic-ultramafic magmatism","Nuna/Columbia supercontinent","Sarmatia"]},{"key":"HKXF6TTH","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Yichao"},{"firstName":"Huang","lastName":" Hu"},{"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":" Guoqing"},{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":" Qiang"},{"firstName":"Tao","lastName":" Jin"},{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":" Yali"},{"firstName":"Lin","lastName":" Junliang"}],"title":"Aboveground mangrove biomass estimation in Beibu Gulf using machine learning and UAV remote sensing","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146816","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721018842","abstract_note":"On the basis of canopy height variables, vegetation index, texture index, and laser point cloud index measured with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) low altitude remote sensing, we used eight machine learning (ML) models to estimate the aboveground biomass of different species of mangroves in Beibu Gulf and compared the accuracy of different ML models for these estimations. The main species of typical mangrove communities in Kangxiling were Aegiceras corniculata and Sonneratia apetala. The trunks of Sonneratia apetala were thicker, with an average height of 11.82 m, whereas Aegiceras corniculata trees were shorter, with an average height of 2.58 m. The XGBoost regressor (XGBR) model had the highest accuracy in estimating mangrove aboveground biomass (R2 = 0.8319, RMSE = 22.7638 Mg/ha), followed by the random forest regressor model (R2 = 0.7887, RMSE = 25.5193 Mg/ha). Support vector regression, decision tree regressor, and extra trees regressor had poor fitting effects. Mangrove texture index ranked first in importance for the model, followed by the mangrove laser point cloud height index, and the laser point cloud intensity index performed the worst in the model. Mangrove aboveground biomass in the study area is high in the north and low in the south, ranging from 38.23 to 171.80 Mg/ha, with an average value of 94.37 Mg/ha.

Nonetheless, how the biomass and sediment organic carbon (SOC) of mangrove forests are affected by marine pollution, in addition to climate and tidal range, on a regional scale is unknown. This study aimed to assess how spatial patterns of biomass and SOC could be influenced by the climate, tidal range, and marine pollution in China’s mangrove forests. The result showed that aboveground biomass (AGB), surface SOC content (SOCC), and SOC density (SOCD) showed clear latitudinal change patterns on a regional scale and decreased in a non-linear manner with increasing latitude. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that latitudinal variation in AGB, SOCC, and SOCD was mainly regulated by temperature-related indicators. However, AGB, SOCC, and SOCD were not found to be correlated to annual precipitation. Besides, the tidal range was found to be negatively correlated to biomass and SOC content/stock. Tidal range is one important abiotic predictor used to understand the latitudinal patterns of mangrove biomass and SOC dynamics. Correlation analysis and PCA revealed that mangrove biomass and SOC content/stock were negatively affected by heavy metal pollution, and they were disproportionately negatively correlated to marine heavy metal concentrations in the coastlines neighboring mangrove forests. Environmentally-sound technology should be adapted to prevent, control, and remediate heavy metal pollution to increase carbon storage in China’s mangrove forests. Mangrove biomass and SOC content/stock were also found to be negatively related to the suspended solid concentration in the coastlines neighboring mangrove forests. In contrast, vegetation biomass was found to be positively correlated to ammonia nitrogen content. However, biomass was found to be not correlated to nitrate-nitrogen, nitrites-nitrogen, inorganic forms of nitrogen, and non-ionic ammonia. Additional studies are needed to confirm the mechanisms by which different forms of nitrogen enrichment affect biomass storage.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"105270","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climate","Mangrove forest","Carbon dynamics","Marine pollution","Tidal range"]},{"key":"E2YWW7N7","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Hayward","lastName":"Robin M."},{"firstName":"Banin","lastName":" Lindsay F."},{"firstName":"Burslem","lastName":" David F.

However, the impacts of logging and active restoration, by liberation cutting and enrichment planting, on tree community composition are poorly understood compared to trajectories of biomass recovery. Here, we assess the long-term impacts of selective logging and active restoration for biomass recovery on tree species diversity, community composition, and forest structure. We censused all stems ≥2 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) on 46 permanent plots in unlogged, primary forest in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA; 12 plots, totalling 0.6 ha) and in sites logged 23–35 years prior to the census in the Ulu Segama Forest Reserve adjacent to DVCA (34 plots, totalling 1.7 ha) in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Active restoration treatments, including enrichment planting and climber cutting, were implemented on 17 of the logged forest plots 12–24 years prior to the census. Total plot-level basal area and pole (5–10 cm DBH) stem density were lower in logged than unlogged forests, however no difference was found in stem density amongst saplings (2–5 cm DBH) or established trees (≥10 cm DBH). Neither basal area, nor plot-level stem density varied with time since logging at any size class, although sapling and pole stem densities were lower in actively restored than naturally regenerating logged forest. Sapling species diversity was lower in logged than unlogged forest, however there were no other significant effects of logging on tree species richness or diversity indices. Tree species composition, however, differed between logged and unlogged forests across all stem size classes (PERMANOVA), reflected by 23 significant indicator species that were only present in unlogged forest. PERMANOVA tests revealed no evidence that overall species composition changed with time since logging or with active restoration treatments at any size class. However, when naturally regenerating and actively restored communities were compared, two indicator species were identified in naturally regenerating forest and three in actively restored forests. Together our results suggest that selective logging has a lasting effect on tree community composition regardless of active restoration treatments and, even when species richness and diversity are stable, species composition remains distinct from unlogged forest for more than two decades post-harvest. Active restoration efforts should be targeted, monitored, and refined to try to ensure positive outcomes for multiple metrics of forest recovery.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"119036","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Selectivelogging","Tropical forest","Species diversity","Enrichment planting","Lowland rain forest","Silviculture"]},{"key":"TJ34TWCP","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Oyedotun","lastName":"Temitope D.

These issues transcend one single country but cut across many countries in the continent. This review provides useful information and synthesised insights that support current and future bibliography queries, research and studies of rivers and streams of South America. It is also noted here that both indices of natural and anthropogenic processes are dictating various environmental challenges confronting surface water systems. The knowledge of the processes and their effects are very important if a proper plan is to be made in addressing those challenges.

We find that historical social-political dynamics involving unsustainable development and settlement patterns, the weakness of local institutions, population mistrust in public authorities, high social inequalities and environmental degradation maintained Saint-Martin on a maladaptive trajectory through powerful reinforcing mechanisms operating both between and during cyclonic events. This study demonstrates that long-term interdisciplinary approaches are required for a better understanding of path dependency and the identification of levers to break it in risk-prone contexts. In Saint-Martin, breaking path dependency requires the alignment of local institutional capacities with national risk reduction policies, the promotion of social justice and involvement of local communities in decision making.

Understanding the developmental history of forests and natural resources of a country will also help us to understand the opportunities and challenges posed for foresters and natural resource managers in these areas. This knowledge may also allow us to speculate on how the developmental situation in another country may have evolved had the initial endowment of resources and developmental circumstances been different.

However, we argue that these two distinctive types of deep-water sediment supply to the basin floor and to the margin are generally not operating at the same time and should not be seen as integral parts of a single model. When shelf-incising canyons were actively bypassing sediments across the margin, the margin itself was not prograding, and vice versa. We present stratigraphic data for some 111 global examples of shelf- and slope-incising canyons and their linked basin-floor sediments, and we provide criteria to distinguish them from prograding margins fed by shelf-edge deltas and their linked slope channels and toe-of-slope fans. The defining character of the canyon feeding system is basin-floor sediment aggradation and the onlapping of this stratigraphy against an eroded basin margin. For many of our examples this onlap persists for millions to tens of millions of years and is especially prolonged in periods of persistent high eustatic sea level. This is in clear contrast to the downlapping stratigraphy that dominates during intervals of high sediment supply from the shelf, and active margin accretion. Some 60% of the ancient canyon/basin-floor fan systems are inferred to have been sourced by canyons tapping longshore drift in littoral cells; they are inferred because with canyon capture, tapped littoral cells are generally depleted and not preserved. In other cases, shelf-incising canyons tapped documented deltas on the inner or middle shelf, but in some other cases, a deltaic or riverine source was inferred. Canyon cutting and initial sediment bypass through the canyons are chiefly associated with initially ‘out-of-grade’ margins—for example, where a carbonate margin has foundered and oversteepened or where large-scale collapse of aggradational and oversteepened clastic shelf edges occurred. Canyon feeding onto the basin floor is linked with runout of basin-floor fans to the basin center, in contrast to direct-fed prograding margins, where sediment is continuously partitioned onto and across the entire shelf-edge, slope, and toe-of-slope areas.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"103531","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Basin-floorfan systems","Canyon capture","Canyon-fed submarine fans","Continuing and ongoing canyon/fan systems","Deep basinal deposits","Direct-fed submarine fans","Downlapped canyon/fan systems","Including modern systems","Marine flooded shelves","Onlap wedge","Shelf- and slope-incising submarine canyons","Slope fan systems","Toe-of-slope fan systems"]},{"key":"W86B5F2Z","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Coletto","lastName":"Juliano L."},{"firstName":"Botta","lastName":" Silvina"},{"firstName":"Fischer","lastName":" Luciano G."},{"firstName":"Newsome","lastName":" Seth D."},{"firstName":"Madureira","lastName":" Lauro S.

These issues with data availability and quality pose challenges to coastal wetlands scientists to account for the spatial variability of blue C stocks in mangroves, particularly when using predictive models based on environmental correlates.

Mangrove growth is conditional on water and sediment budgets at the coastal interface. This basic ecological principle has been ignored in many mangrove restoration or rehabilitation programs, leading to failures in the design of successful and cost-effective ecosystem restoration and rehabilitation. This chapter highlights how restoring tidal flows can adequately supply sediments to the mangrove system and stimulate its recovery in abandoned aquaculture ponds, where hydrology was previously constrained by pond walls. Tidal flows transport sediments that accumulate in the pond, causing an increase in soil surface elevation; a key factor in both helping minerogenic mangroves maintain their elevation in the face of sea level rise and improving the local blue carbon balance through carbon accumulation. In a number of cases, tidal flow also facilitates the dispersal of mangrove propagules over the site, contributing to subsequent mangrove development. As restoring the hydrological regime is most likely to have positive contributions to the early development of mangroves in abandoned ponds, it should be considered as a “nature-inspired” alternative to plantation programs. Our work suggests that such “passive” mangrove restoration strategies are to be preferred as they provide better opportunities for blue carbon abatement and increase resilience of coasts to rising sea levels and biodiversity loss.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"563-582","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mangroverestoration","Abandoned ponds","Hydrological regime","Sediment dynamics"]},{"key":"GF7Q8X4D","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"MacKenzie","lastName":"Richard"},{"firstName":"Sharma","lastName":" Sahadev"},{"firstName":"Rovai","lastName":" Andre R."}],"title":"Chapter 12 - Environmental drivers of blue carbon burial and soil carbon stocks in mangrove forests","publication_title":"Dynamic Sedimentary Environments of Mangrove Coasts","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128164372000069","abstract_note":"Mangroves can sequester and store massive amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere in the form of live plant and detrital biomass. Large amounts of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon (C) are also stored in sediments, where waterlogged and anoxic conditions inhibit microbial breakdown of organic matter. As a result, C buried in sediments of mangroves can remain there for millennia if left undisturbed, making them critical long-term C sinks. These high levels of aboveground and belowground C stocks have elevated the importance of mangroves and other blue carbon habitats in climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as efforts to protect and restore them. While methods have been developed for quantifying and reporting C stocks, the environmental drivers that influence the accumulation and retention of C stocks in blue carbon habitats are lesser known. Identifying important drivers of C accumulation in blue carbon habitats will increase conservation and restoration efforts so that they can continue to mitigate climate change by offsetting greenhouse gas emissions. Successful restoration and conservation activities can also be used in nationally determined commitments or in voluntary C markets.

Mangrove ecosystems have gained major attention in the scientific community and the public in recent years, because they are considered a major natural carbon sink. However, uncertainties on the magnitude of this sink and the underlying processes are still large. A unique feature of mangrove ecosystems is their ability to store not only internally produced organic matter but also to store carbon derived from external sources. In the context of balancing anthropogenic CO2 emissions, it is of relevance to know whether the carbon stored is autochthonous, i.e., derived from the recent fixation of CO2 in the mangrove ecosystems, or it is allochthonous, i.e., relocated and possibly old carbon from other reservoirs. The relevance of these aspects is illustrated at the example of the mangrove-fringed coastal Segara Anakan Lagoon in Java, Indonesia, which is fed by a river that drains an agriculture-dominated hinterland.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"393-414","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange mitigation","Allochthonous input","Blue Carbon","Indonesia","Mangrove sediment","Natural carbon sink","Stable isotopes"]},{"key":"ABDIZQ95","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Scarano","lastName":"Fabio R."},{"firstName":"Fornero Aguiar","lastName":" Anna C."},{"firstName":"Mittermeier","lastName":" Russell A."},{"firstName":"Rylands","lastName":" Anthony B."}],"title":"Megadiversity","publication_title":"Reference Module in Life Sciences","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012822562200013X","abstract_note":"Eighteen megadiversity countries are home to 70% of the species in the world.

Under climate change, mosquitoes and the pathogens that they carry are expected to develop faster, potentially impacting the case count and duration of YF outbreaks. The aim of this study was to determine how YF virus outbreaks in Brazil may change under future climate, using ensemble simulations from regional climate models under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for three time periods: 2011–2040 (short-term), 2041–2070 (mid-term), and 2071–2100 (long-term). Methods A compartmental model was developed to fit the 2017/18 YF outbreak data in Brazil using least squares optimization. To explore the impact of climate change, temperature-sensitive mosquito parameters were set to change over projected time periods using polynomial equations fitted to their relationship with temperature according to the average temperature for years 2011–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2100 for climate change scenarios using RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, where RCP4.5/RCP8.5 corresponds to intermediate/high radiative forcing values and to moderate/higher warming trends. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine how the temperature-sensitive parameters impacted model results, and to determine how vaccination could play a role in reducing YF in Brazil. Results Yellow fever case projections for Brazil from the models varied when climate change scenarios were applied, including the peak clinical case incidence, cumulative clinical case incidence, time to peak incidence, and the outbreak duration. Overall, a decrease in YF cases and outbreak duration was observed. Comparing the observed incidence in 2017/18 to the projected incidence in 2070–2100, for RCP4.5, the cumulative case incidence decreased from 184 to 161, and the outbreak duration decreased from 21 to 20 weeks. For RCP8.5, the peak case incidence decreased from 184 to 147, and the outbreak duration decreased from 21 to 17 weeks. The observed decrease was primarily due to temperature increasing beyond that suitable for Haemagogus mosquito survival. Conclusions Climate change is anticipated to have an impact on mosquito-borne diseases. We found outbreaks of YF may reduce in intensity as temperatures increase in Brazil; however, temperature is not the only factor involved with disease transmission. Other factors must be explored to determine the attributable impact of climate change on mosquito-borne diseases.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"664-677","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Temperature","Yellow fever","Infectious disease model","Mosquito-borne disease"]},{"key":"HBQDTFN4","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Azman","lastName":"Mohd.

With exact stand age known, assessment of forest structure, biodiversity and biomass along a natural mangrove development chronosequence provides valuable information to define how long it takes mangrove restoration to return to a natural baseline condition. In natural settings, it is hypothesized that forest structure, diversity and biomass increase with stand age and that these are highest and most complex in intact mangroves. Thus, the study analyzed dynamics in species composition, forest structure and biomass across intact as well as naturally regenerated (NR) stands from 3, 6, 12, 18, and 25 years of age. Intact mangrove stands were structurally more complex and more diverse than younger stands. The preponderance of A. marina regeneration that appear for succession gives rise to a high importance value in the study area. The mean for above-ground and below-ground biomass was 71.00 ± 2.30 and 36.07 ± 0.52 Mg ha−1, respectively. Mean individual tree mass to tree density relationship resembles the mean tree weight–density trajectory of self-thinning even-aged plant populations where mean individual tree mass increased with decreasing density. Naturally regenerated mangroves supported higher tree diversity with complex in stand structure compared to restored mangroves, which were basically comprised of Rhizophora species. Restored mangroves attain higher biomass in a shorter period of time compared to naturally regenerated mangroves. Mangrove restoration should focus on naturally regenerated mangroves in order to increase carbon sequestration and thus provide climate change mitigation. Ecosystem services, biodiversity and climate change mitigation values need to be considered for both mangrove types as restored mangroves lower tree diversity compared to naturally regenerated mangroves of the same age stand. Therefore it is suggested that sustainable management such as silviculture method might be suitable for naturally regenerated mangroves to absorb more carbon from atmosphere and maintain the higher diversity.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"118852","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mangrove","Biomass","Forest structure","Melaka","Secondary forest","Self thinning","Stand age"]},{"key":"KHE6RJP7","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Pinto","lastName":"Luiz Otávio Rodrigues"},{"firstName":"Souza","lastName":" Cléber Rodrigo de"},{"firstName":"Terra","lastName":" Marcela de Castro Nunes Santos"},{"firstName":"Mello","lastName":" José Márcio de"},{"firstName":"Calegário","lastName":" Natalino"},{"firstName":"Arcebi Júnior","lastName":" Fausto Weimar"}],"title":"Optimal plot size for carbon-diversity sampling in tropical vegetation","publication_title":"Forest Ecology and Management","issn":"0378-1127","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118778","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112720315474","abstract_note":"Obtaining high-quality information on vegetation attributes directly linked to ecosystem services in tropical forests, such as carbon stock and biodiversity, is essential to develop ecological information to be used in planning conservation strategies. Defining the optimum vegetation sample plots size is an important part of the process of obtaining information, since is crucial for its quality, and also for its financial costs and time required. In this context, we evaluated whether: (i) the optimum plot size selected in two approaches (basal area/carbon stock vs biodiversity) are different since they are associated with different ecological drivers; (ii) different tropical forests vegetation types present different optimum sample plot size due to their ecological specific attributes, such as species composition, structure and functioning. For this we evaluated the vegetation sample plots optimum size of different vegetation types of tropical savanna and forest of broad occurrence in the tropics (Atlantic Semideciduous Forest – ASF; Cerrado Woodland – CW; Cerrado Forest – CF; and Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest - SDTF), in two approaches: forest basal area and carbon stock, since they are related variables; and biodiversity variables by species composition similarity and heterogeneity in communities. We used 4 forest fragments in Brazil that were sampled in a way that allowed the arrange of subplots to form different plot sizes. In order to evaluate the optimum sample plot size in the basal area/carbon stock approach we used four methodologies, in which the obtained variability was compared to a reference size (1000 m2). For the biodiversity approach we used the floristic similarity and composition heterogeneity between units as metric, evaluating differences in the similarity patterns and possible reductions or increases in variability compared to the reference size. We found there are no significant differences for biodiversity variables between sample plot sizes for all vegetation types, thus the optimum size may be selected using just the basal area/carbon stock approach. In the basal area/carbon stock approach, most of the evaluated methods generally presented lower plot size values compared to the reference size (1000 m2) in all vegetation types, except for the ASF. There are differences between vegetation types that may be grouped in two groups related to the optimum size selected, that are related to their ecological restriction patterns: CW, CF and SDTF with optimum size between 600 and 1000 m2; and the second with ASF, with optimum sample plot size between 1000 m2 and 1400 m2.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"118778","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Tropicalforest","Forest inventory","Sampling methods","Tree biomass","Tree diversity"]},{"key":"ZML9YCI3","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Reis","lastName":"Humberto L.

Spanning almost 88% of the planet's history, this time interval has been divided according to major geological events recorded on Earth and encompasses the informal Hadean (4.56–4.0Ga) and the formal Archean (4.0–2.5Ga) and Proterozoic (2.5–0.541Ga) eons. Due to the absent to poorly-preserved rock record and the lack of index fossils throughout most of its extent, the Precambrian is still less well known than the Phanerozoic. Nevertheless, recent scientific advances and the study of Precambrian units preserved in ancient cratons and adjacent areas have allowed remarkable progress in its understanding. The available information indicates that, after accretion from the Solar Nebula, the early Earth was dominated by extreme conditions and extreme impact rates that also induced the formation of the Moon. The primitive hydrosphere-atmosphere, the biosphere and an early magnetosphere emerged in this interval, under planetary tectonic modes similar to those observed on the Galilean moon Io and/or Venus. The early Archean onset in the secular cooling of the mantle was accompanied by the formation and preservation of remarkable volumes of unique continental crust types and the spread of shallow marine to continental sedimentary systems, which hosted some of the oldest well-known life forms and evolved under dominant anoxic atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Following a period dominated by plume activity and transient, hot shallow-dipping subduction systems, the Proterozoic was marked by the gradual emergence of plate tectonics and the onset of the supercontinent cycle. This eon witnessed the increasing maturity of sedimentary systems, extreme global climate changes, the shift in the genesis of major economic resources, the rise of photosynthetic organisms, eukaryotes, macroscopic life forms and the coupled evolution of the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. In the late Neoproterozoic, renewed plate reorganizations were accompanied by Snowball Earth glaciations, the emergence of metazoans and biomineralization processes, the complete oxygenation of oceans and atmosphere and the assembly of the 630–500Ma Gondwana supercontinent (precursor of Wegener's Pangea). Although much is still to be done and understood, it is apparent that the foundations which made Earth a unique planet in the Solar System were built in the Precambrian. This time interval contains the roots of our ancestral history and offers a window into the early Earth and the deep time itself.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"23-54","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Platetectonics","Atmosphere","Deep time","Early Earth","First continents","Metazoans","Modern Earth","Moon","Oceans","Origin of life"]},{"key":"TPJWF56W","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Nunes","lastName":"Beatriz Zachello"},{"firstName":"Zanardi-Lamardo","lastName":" Eliete"},{"firstName":"Choueri","lastName":" Rodrigo Brasil"},{"firstName":"Castro","lastName":" Ítalo Braga"}],"title":"Marine protected areas in Latin America and Caribbean threatened by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","publication_title":"Environmental Pollution","issn":"0269-7491","doi":"10.1016/j.envpol.2020.116194","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120368834","abstract_note":"The present study is a literature-based analysis investigating occurrence and the possible consequences of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in marine protected areas (MPAs) of Latin America and Caribbean.

Parasitoid wasps of this superfamily are mostly beneficial insects that attack and kill other arthropods and are important for understanding diversification and the evolution of life history strategies related to parasitoidism. Further, some lineages of parasitoids within Ichneumonoidea have acquired endogenous virus elements (EVEs) that are permanently a part of the wasp’s genome and benefit the wasp through host immune disruption and behavioral control. Unfortunately, understanding the evolution of viral acquisition, parasitism strategies, diversification, and host immune disruption mechanisms, is deeply limited by the lack of a robust phylogenetic framework for Ichneumonoidea. Here we design probes targeting 541 genes across 91 taxa to test phylogenetic relationships, the evolution of parasitoid strategies, and the utility of probes to capture polydnavirus genes across a diverse array of taxa. Phylogenetic relationships among Ichneumonoidea were largely well resolved with most higher-level relationships maximally supported. We noted codon use biases between the outgroups, Braconidae, and Ichneumonidae and within Pimplinae, which were largely solved through analyses of amino acids rather than nucleotide data. These biases may impact phylogenetic reconstruction and caution for outgroup selection is recommended. Ancestral state reconstructions were variable for Braconidae across analyses, but consistent for reconstruction of idiobiosis/koinobiosis in Ichneumonidae. The data suggest many transitions between parasitoid life history traits across the whole superfamily. The two subfamilies within Ichneumonidae that have polydnaviruses are supported as distantly related, providing strong evidence for two independent acquisitions of ichnoviruses. Polydnavirus capture using our designed probes was only partially successful and suggests that more targeted approaches would be needed for this strategy to be effective for surveying taxa for these viral genes. In total, these data provide a robust framework for the evolution of Ichneumonoidea.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"107023","language":"en","automatic_tags":["AncestralState Reconstruction","Anchored hybrid enrichment","Braconidae","Ichneumonidae","Parasitoid wasps","Polydnavirus"]},{"key":"NGEJ3WSP","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Hayden","lastName":"B."},{"firstName":"Tongnunui","lastName":" S."},{"firstName":"Beamish","lastName":" F.

Over the last decades, various geochemical signals and proxy records, including δ13C, pCO2, iridium and other platinum-group elements, mercury, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), charcoal and SO2, have been directly or indirectly attributed to CAMP magmatism. Here, we compile these various records in a stratigraphic framework to present a cohesive chain of events for the CAMP and the end-Triassic mass extinction. Mercury and iridium anomalies in sediments indicate that CAMP activity commenced prior to the onset of the marine extinctions (as marked by the last occurrence of the Triassic ammonoid Choristoceras marshi or closely related species), and a negative δ13C excursion in organic matter (the Marshi CIE). This CIE may be explained by input of light carbon to the atmosphere from CAMP lavas of the Tiourjdal and Prevalent groups. Pedogenic carbonate below and above the Prevalent group in North America indicates a more than twofold increase in atmospheric pCO2. Subsequent n-alkane C-isotopes, and stomatal pCO2 data seem to indicate a temporary cooling after the Marshi CIE, which is consistent with climate models incorporating volcanic emissions of both CO2 and SO2. Records of excess iridium and Hg/TOC indicate intensified magmatism during the extinction interval. Tectonic and perhaps epeirogenic (i.e. doming due to rise of magma) activity is suggested by the occurrence of multiple and widespread seismites in Europe. Atmospheric pCO2 proxies indicate global warming, which culminated contemporaneously with the Spelae CIE. Global warming is corroborated by increased wildfire activity testified by charcoal and pyrolytic PAH records. Increased isotopic ratios of Os and Sr from sections that record global ocean signatures suggest increased weathering of continental crust likely due to climatic changes. Just prior to the increase in pCO2 from stomatal proxy data, fossil plants exhibit SO2-induced damage indicating excess sulfur dioxide deposition priot to and across the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. At the same time, increased ratios of heavy molecular PAHs (coronene/benzo(a)pyrene) in sediments suggest metamorphism of organic sediments also occurred across the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. These proxies may suggest that thermogenic release of light carbon and sulfur from sill intrusions in the Trans-Amazonian basins, where both evaporate- and organic-rich sediments are known to have been intruded, may have played an important role during the course of the ETME. Geochemical traces of magmatism, i.e. Ir and Hg, appear to have gradually disappeared during the Hettangian, suggesting that later phases of CAMP were less voluminous. Stomatal proxy data from Greenland and n-alkane C-isotope data from the UK, together with oxygen isotope data from carbonate fossils in the UK, may indicate that the global warming at the Spelae CIE was succeeded by another short-term cooling event. A gradual decrease in δ13C culminated at the top-Tilmanni CIE, marking the beginning of a long-term steady state with more negative C-isotope values than prior to the ETME. At this time, terrestrial ecosystems appear to have stabilized globally and ammonoids had begun to rediversify.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"103444","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Volcanism","C-isotope","Iridium","Mercury","PAH","Triassic–Jurassic boundary"]},{"key":"RTCH5E3V","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Cielo-Filho","lastName":"Roque"}],"title":"Drought severity, disturbance intensity and wood density of dominant and rare tree species in Brazilian seasonally dry semideciduous forests","publication_title":"Flora","issn":"0367-2530","doi":"10.1016/j.flora.2020.151733","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0367253020302322","abstract_note":"Wood density is one of the main functional traits affecting demographic rates of tropical trees. However, little is known about how this translates into abundance of trees in local assemblages. I hypothesized that: (1) higher wood density would generally result in better adaptation to prevailing environmental conditions in seasonally dry semideciduous forests, which would translate into numerical dominance of denser-wood species; (2 and 3, respectively) as drought severity and disturbance intensity increase, the performance of individuals of denser-wood species would drop, so that the numerical dominance of those species would decline. A community-level functional measure (ΔMWD) was used to access the role played by wood density in shaping numerical dominance in assemblages. I obtained the value of ΔMWD for 30 local assemblages by computing the difference between wood density mean value of two species groups in each assemblage: dominant and rare. The proportion of ΔMWD positive values was significantly greater than 0.5, thus supporting hypothesis 1. This finding may be explained by the possible ability of denser-wood species to continue growing under drought conditions due to greater resistance to drought-induced cavitation of vessels associated with higher wood density. Pearson correlation coefficients between ΔMWD and drought severity and between ΔMWD and disturbance intensity were negative and statistically significant, supporting hypotheses 2 and 3, respectively. Also supporting these hypotheses, Glm fitting showed that drought severity and disturbance intensity had significant negative effects on ΔMWD; and the median values of ΔMWD of the subsets of assemblages showing higher levels of drought severity and disturbance intensity were significantly smaller than that of their respective counterparts. These findings may be explained by shifts of adaptive advantages from denser-wood drought tolerant strategists to softer-wood drought avoidance strategists, and from denser-wood resource conservative strategists to softer-wood resource acquisitive strategists, as drought severity and disturbance intensity increase, respectively.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"151733","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Commonness","Community organization","Environmental gradients","Functional ecology","Trade-offs","Trait-environment relationships"]},{"key":"IE4NF2UA","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Xin"},{"firstName":"Liang","lastName":" Naishen"},{"firstName":"Zeng","lastName":" Jiye"},{"firstName":"Mohti","lastName":" Azian"}],"title":"A simple model for partitioning forest soil respiration based on root allometry","publication_title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","issn":"0038-0717","doi":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.108067","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071720303631","abstract_note":"Partitioning soil respiration (Rs) into heterotrophic (Rh) and autotrophic (Ra) compartments is an important first step in understanding the response of soil carbon flux to changes in climate. This is because Rh and Ra respond differently to changing environmental conditions. However, the methods currently used to partition Rs have high costs and large uncertainties. In this study, we developed a simple model to partition forest Rs based on root biomass, Rs=Rh+∑i=1n[ci×DBHidi×f(Di)], which the latter is modelled as the sum of root biomass density (MT) derived from an existing root allometric equation (MT=c×DBHd, where DBH is tree diameter at breast height) multiplied by a horizonal distance function (f(D)) based on the relationship between in situ Rs and distance (D) from the tree base. We applied this model to a complex tropical natural forest in Southeast Asia by inputting a site-specific root allometric equation and in situ Rs–D function to obtain: Rs=Rh+c′∑i=1n(DBHi2.59×Di−0.452). Compared to studies that used the classical root biomass regression, our results show a stronger linear correlation between Rs and simulated root biomass density (r2 = 0.797). By using the y-intercept (i.e. no root biomass at all), Rh was estimated to contribute 66.9 ± 5.7% to total Rs. We validated the root-allometry-based model by using the trenching method. In our study area, it took about 1 week (6.5 days) for tree roots to die after trenching, and Rh/Rs ratios estimated from our model were about 2.7% higher than those estimated with the trenching method. With the increasing number of allometry equations for global woody plants, the model has the potential of being used to partition Rs in various forests at regional or global scales.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"108067","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Heterotrophicrespiration","Automated chamber","Autotrophic respiration","Root-allometry model","Trenching"]},{"key":"HUPTSUY6","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Odonne","lastName":"Guillaume"},{"firstName":"Tareau","lastName":" Marc-Alexandre"},{"firstName":"van Andel","lastName":" Tinde"}],"title":"Geopolitics of bitterness: Deciphering the history and cultural biogeography of Quassia amara L","publication_title":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","issn":"0378-8741","doi":"10.1016/j.jep.2020.113546","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874120334346","abstract_note":"Ethnopharmacological relevance Quassia amara L. recently came into the spotlight in French Guiana, when it became the object of a biopiracy claim. Due to the numerous use records throughout the Guiana shield, at least since the 18th century, a thorough investigation of its origin seemed relevant and timely. In the light of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya protocol, questions about the origin of local knowledge are important to debate. Aim of the study: Defining cultural biogeography as the dynamics through space and time of biocultural complexes, we used this theoretical framework to shed light on the complex biogeographical and cultural history of Q. amara. We explored in particular the possible transfer of medicinal knowledge on an Old World species to a botanically related New World one by enslaved Africans in Suriname. Materials and methods Historical and contemporary literature research was performed by means of digitized manuscripts, archives and databases from the 17th to the 21st century. We retrieved data from digitized herbarium vouchers in herbaria of the Botanic Garden Meise (Belgium); Naturalis Biodiversity Center (the Netherlands); Missouri Botanical Garden, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the Field Museum (USA); Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (UK); the IRD Herbarium, French Guiana and the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle (France). Vernacular names were retrieved from literature and herbarium specimens and compared to verify the origin of Quassia amara and its uses. Results Our exploration of digitized herbarium vouchers resulted in 1287 records, of which 661 were Q. amara and 636 were Q. africana. We observed that the destiny of this species, over at least 300 years, interweaves politics, economy, culture and medicine in a very complex way. Quassia amara's uses are difficult to attribute to specific cultural groups: the species is widely distributed in Central and South America, where it is popular among many ethnic groups. The species spread from Central to South America during the early 18th century due to political and economic reasons. This migration possibly resulted from simultaneous migration by religious orders (Jesuits) from Central America to northern South America and by Carib-speaking Amerindians (from northern South America to Suriname). Subsequently, through colonial trade networks, Q. amara spread to the rest of the world. The absence of African-derived local names in the Guiana shield suggests that Q. africana was not sufficiently familiar to enslaved Africans in the region that they preserved its names and transferred the associated medicinal knowledge to Q. amara. Conclusions Cultural biogeography has proven an interesting concept to reconstruct the dynamics of biocultural interactions through space and time, while herbarium databases have shown to be useful to decipher evolution of local plant knowledge. Tracing the origin of a knowledge is nevertheless a complex adventure that deserves time and interdisciplinary studies.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"113546","language":"en","automatic_tags":["FrenchGuiana","Suriname","Colonial history","Cultural biogeography","Herbarium specimens","Kwasi"]},{"key":"EVTPWRHM","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Maneja","lastName":"Rommel H."},{"firstName":"Miller","lastName":" Jeffrey D."},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":" Wenzhao"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":" Rejoice"},{"firstName":"El-Askary","lastName":" Hesham"},{"firstName":"Perera","lastName":" Sachi"},{"firstName":"Flandez","lastName":" Ace Vincent B."},{"firstName":"Basali","lastName":" Abdullajid U."},{"firstName":"Alcaria","lastName":" Joselito Francis A."},{"firstName":"Gopalan","lastName":" Jinoy"},{"firstName":"Tiwari","lastName":" Surya"},{"firstName":"Al-Jedani","lastName":" Mubarak"},{"firstName":"Prihartato","lastName":" Perdana K."},{"firstName":"Loughland","lastName":" Ronald A."},{"firstName":"Qasem","lastName":" Ali"},{"firstName":"Qurban","lastName":" Mohamed A."},{"firstName":"Falath","lastName":" Wail"},{"firstName":"Struppa","lastName":" Daniele"}],"title":"Multidecadal analysis of beach loss at the major offshore sea turtle nesting islands in the northern Arabian Gulf","publication_title":"Ecological Indicators","issn":"1470-160X","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107146","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X20310852","abstract_note":"Undocumented historical losses of sea turtle nesting beaches worldwide could overestimate the successes of conservation measures and misrepresent the actual status of the sea turtle population. In addition, the suitability of many sea turtle nesting sites continues to decline even without in-depth scientific studies of the extent of losses and impacts to the population. In this study, multidecadal changes in the outlines and area of Jana and Karan islands, major sea turtle nesting sites in the Arabian Gulf, were compared using available Kodak aerographic images, USGS EROS Declassified satellite imagery, and ESRI satellite images. A decrease of 5.1% and 1.7% of the area of Jana and Karan islands, respectively, were observed between 1965 and 2017. This translated to 14,146 m2 of beach loss at Jana Is. and 16,376 m2 of beach loss at Karan Is. There was an increase of island extent for Karan Is. from 1965 to 1968 by 9098 m2 but comparing 2017 with 1968, Karan Is. lost as much as 25,474 m2 or 2.6% of the island extent in 1968. The decrease in island aerial extent was attributed to loss of beach sand. The southern tips of the island lost the most significant amount of sand. There was also thinning of beach sand along the middle and northern sections that exposed the rock outcrops underneath the beach. The process of beach changes of both islands was tracked by the satellite imagery from Landsat 1,3,5,7 and Sentinel-2 during 1972 to 2020. Other factors including the distribution of beach slope, sea level changes, as well as wind & current from both northward and eastward components were analyzed to show its impact on the beach changes. The loss of beach sand could potentially impact the quality and availability of nesting beach for sea turtles utilizing the islands as main nesting grounds. Drivers of beach loss at the offshore islands are discussed in the context of sea level rise, dust storms, extreme wave heights and island desertification.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"107146","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Coastalsqueeze","Arabian Gulf","Beach loss","Jana Is","Karan Is.","Landsat 1,3,5,7","Satellite imagery","Sea turtle nesting beaches","Sentinel-2"]},{"key":"EBA6JIQ6","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Senesi","lastName":"Giorgio S."},{"firstName":"Harmon","lastName":" Russell S."},{"firstName":"Hark","lastName":" Richard R."}],"title":"Field-portable and handheld laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy: Historical review, current status and future prospects","publication_title":"Spectrochimica Acta Part B: Atomic Spectroscopy","issn":"0584-8547","doi":"10.1016/j.sab.2020.106013","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0584854720304523","abstract_note":"The first part of this review describes laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) instrumentation for in situ measurement outside the laboratory, both prototype instruments and commercially available analyzers that can be operated by a single individual.

In the laboratory, shrimps were exposed for one week to: i) undisturbed conditions; ii) Al2O3 exposure (0.5 mg L−1) at normal pH (6.6); iii) decreased pH (4.5) (mimicking HCl release in the environment) with no Al2O3; or iv) Al2O3 0.5 mg L−1 and pH 4.5, representing the average conditions found in the water bodies around the Ariane 5 launch pad.

The combined effect of Al2O3 and low pH caused the most impact: acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activities decreased, indicating neurotoxicity and reduced detoxification capacity, respectively. Animal respiration was enhanced with Al2O3 and pH variations alone, but the synergic interaction of both stressors caused respiration to decrease, suggesting metabolic depression. Oxidative damage followed a similar pattern to respiration rates across conditions, suggesting free radical-mediation in Al toxicity. Antioxidant activities varied among enzymes, with glutathione reductase being the most impacted by Al2O3 exposure.

This unique habitat provides important ecosystem services to coastal communities worldwide, but the global decline of their surface area and their degradation over the past decades has put coastal communities even more at risk from the effects of climate change. This paper aims to present the first ecosystem services valuation of the mangroves of the French overseas Territories. We provide the economic value of mangroves for coastal protection, carbon sequestration, water purification and fish biomass production. We coupled a geospatial analysis of mangrove's distribution with the characterisation of land artificialisation behind mangroves. Then we developed a vulnerability index based on multiple indicators of exposure to environmental and anthropogenic stressors, mangroves' sensitivity to pressures, and mangroves' adaptive capacity to adjust their production functions accordingly. We estimated the monetary value of regulation and support services provided by mangroves in French overseas territories to be on average EUR 1.6 billion annually, 60% of which is carbon sequestration, 28% coastal protection, 7% water purification and 6% fish biomass production. When considering mangroves services without the vulnerability adjustment, the total value for those services would reach EUR 2 billion per year. Although much of the spatio-temporal variability in mangrove functioning could not be considered given the spatial scale of our study, these results demonstrate the value and socio-economic importance of mangroves to face and adapt from the effects of coastal change, at local and national scales, but also highlight the loss of services due to their vulnerability. This paper emphasises on the value of ecosystem services provided by mangroves to face coastal change so that a service-based approach to conservation would plead for increased national investment into their protection.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"143004","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Carbonsequestration","Mangroves","Coastal protection","Fish biomass production","Vulnerability index","Water purification"]},{"key":"I4X7H2HM","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Do","lastName":"Anh T.

Among them, the numerous estuaries along the Guiana shoreline present at least two original features: they are still preserved from anthropogenic modifications, and their hydro-morphodynamics are influenced by longshore migration of outer coastal mud banks. This study deals with the Maroni estuary, a mesotidal preserved tropical estuary, currently spotting more attention to better anticipate changes related to the development of harbour activities. Field data collected over semi-diurnal tidal cycles in the lower estuary revealed the presence of a turbidity maximum and seasonally contrasted hydro-sedimentary features. A one-year 3D hydrodynamic simulation covering a wide-range of tidal and fluvial conditions was performed to further analyse the seasonal variability of stratification and residual circulation patterns. The estuary is well-mixed for a very low river discharge (lower than 200 m3/s). It becomes partly mixed in both spring and neap tide in case of a moderate river discharge of 700 m3/s. The strongest stratification, which could be associated to a salt wedge near the mouth, appears during neap tides combined with higher discharge. Residual currents along the navigation channel are usually seaward except during neap tides when the discharge is large enough (∼700 m3/s) to generate stratification and landward residual current near the bottom to mid depth until the first km 15 from the mouth. Residual inflow starts from the location of the mud bank and extends along the navigation channel near the eastern bank. The inflow extension matches with observed highly turbid areas and fresh mud deposits, suggesting an outer supply of mud. In summary, this exploratory work allows a first description of current dynamics of the Maroni, and is a first step before a comprehensive study of changes in estuarine circulation and fine sediment transport under different configurations of coastal mud banks.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"101493","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Estuarinesediment dynamic","Mud bank","Residual current","Stratification","Tropical estuary","Turbidity maximum"]},{"key":"G27FNGMW","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Ghandi","lastName":"Abbas"},{"firstName":"Paltsev","lastName":" Sergey"}],"title":"Global CO2 impacts of light-duty electric vehicles","publication_title":"Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment","issn":"1361-9209","doi":"10.1016/j.trd.2020.102524","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920920307112","abstract_note":"Electric vehicles (EV) offer a solution for decarbonization of transport.

Archaeobotanical studies are providing a far greater appreciation of the role of plants in the diets of early colonists. Since ∼13ka, these diets relied mainly on palm, tree fruits, and underground tubers, along with terrestrial and riverine faunal resources. Recent evidence indicates two areas of precocious plant cultivation and domestication: the sub-Andean montane forest of NW South America and the shrub savannahs and seasonal forests of SW Amazonia. In the latter area, thousands of anthropic keystone structures represented by forest islands show a significant human footprint in Amazonia from the start of the Holocene. While radiocarbon date databases show a decline in population during the middle Holocene, important developments happened during this epoch, including the domestication of cacao, the adoption of maize and the spread of manioc across the basin. The late Holocene witnessed the domestication of rice and the development of agricultural landscapes characterised by raised fields and Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs). Our multi-proxy analysis of 23 late Holocene ADEs and two lakes from southern Amazonia provides the first direct evidence of field polyculture agriculture including the cultivation of maize, manioc, sweet potato, squash, arrowroot and leren within closed-canopy forest, as well as enrichment with palms, limited clearing for crop cultivation, and low-severity fire management. Collectively, the evidence shows that during the late Holocene Amazonian farmers engaged in intensive agriculture marked by the cultivation of both annual and perennial crops relying on organic amendments requiring soil preparation and maintenance. Our study has broader implications for sustainable Amazonian futures.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"106582","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazon","Land use","Pollen","Agriculture","Charcoal","Phytoliths","Amazonian dark earths","Food production","Plant domestication","Pre-columbian"]},{"key":"YLSSJCMR","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Sukuan"},{"firstName":"Smith","lastName":" Stacey D."}],"title":"Phylogeny and biogeography of South American marsh pitcher plant genus Heliamphora (Sarraceniaceae) endemic to the Guiana Highlands","publication_title":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","issn":"1055-7903","doi":"10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106961","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790320302335","abstract_note":"Heliamphora is a genus of carnivorous pitcher plants endemic to the Guiana Highlands with fragmented distributions.

The calculation of this comminution age is based on measured (234U/238U) activity ratios in river sediments, and inferred time-dependent recoil effect, which leads to the preferential release of 234U from mineral lattices during erosion processes. In this study, we report on a large-scale (234U/238U) investigation of modern river sediments worldwide, with the aim to determine the extent to which parameters such as grain size, lithology, weathering, climate and geomorphology may influence the distribution of U isotopes in fine-grained sediments. Our extensive dataset (N = 64) includes U isotopic measurements for many of the world’s largest rivers, but also rivers draining particular climatic and geological settings. Our results indicate that sediments collected from river basins draining mostly igneous, metamorphic or volcanic rocks often display (234U/238U) ratios > 1, with clay-size fractions (<4 µm) being less depleted in 234U (higher 234U/238U) than corresponding silt-size fractions (4–63 µm). In contrast, sediments derived from multi-lithological basins or draining sedimentary rocks are typically characterized by (234U/238U) ratios <1, with clays generally exhibiting more depleted 234U signatures than silts. Taken together, these observations suggest that the formation of secondary clay minerals in soils from basins draining mostly igneous, metamorphic is accompanied by partial incorporation by recoil injection of 234U initially released during weathering processes, possibly from U-rich minerals, such as sphene or apatite. Instead, in multi-lithological catchments draining sedimentary rocks, we propose that the erosion of recycled sediments having experienced several cycles of weathering, possibly over glacial-interglacial timescales, could explain the much lower (234U/238U) ratios observed in clay-size fractions. While no direct relationships can be identified between sediment (234U/238U) ratios and lithology, weathering intensity, climatic or geomorphic parameters in corresponding river basins, we show that the catchment size probably plays an important role in controlling the distribution of (234U/238U) in river sediments, through its direct influence on the sediment residence time. Finally, a multiple regression analysis of our data, combining various environmental parameters for the lithology, climate and geomorphology of studied river basins, indicates predicted (234U/238U) values that are very similar to measured values (with R2 ∼ 0.8). This finding provides further support for the usefulness of (234U/238U) ratios in the sedimentary record for reconstructing past landscape changes and their effect on sediment transport and residence time in river basins.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"216-234","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Sedimenttransport","Chemical weathering","Clays","Comminution age","Erosion","Silts","Uranium-series isotopes","World rivers"]},{"key":"2UIUU8LW","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Garabedian"},{"firstName":"Avotra","lastName":" Narindranjanahary"},{"firstName":"Olivia","lastName":" Ricci"},{"firstName":"Sandrine","lastName":" Selosse"}],"title":"A macroeconomic evaluation of a carbon tax in overseas territories: A CGE model for Reunion Island","publication_title":"Energy Policy","issn":"0301-4215","doi":"10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111738","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421520304638","abstract_note":"Reunion Island, similar to most insular regions, is ruled by a carbon-based economy that is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. In recent years, the energy transition towards a low-carbon economy has become the watchword of this French overseas region, with the objective of a 100% renewable energy mix by 2030. Reducing fossil fuel use while maintaining economic growth is an important issue for all countries but is even more important for island territories with structural and geographical handicaps. Energy transition and drastic greenhouse gas emission reductions represent costs and opportunities that need to be quantified. This research paper assesses the environmental and macroeconomic effects of the carbon price policy introduced in France to meet the target of the Paris Agreement. The acceptability of the tax significantly depends on the possibility of recycling tax revenues. Different schemes for recycling tax revenues are considered in simulations. The methodology used is a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Reunion Island (GetRun-NRJ) that takes into account all island specificities. The results show that the carbon tax enables substitutions between fossil and renewable energy production and reduces CO2 emissions. However, the tax has negative effects on the aggregate economy. The implemented tax revenue recycling compensation mechanisms mitigate the negative impacts, but the results differ significantly, as the recycling schemes do not support the same economic actors.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"111738","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Carbontax","Computable general equilibrium model","Energy transition","Macroeconomic impacts","Reunion Island"]},{"key":"26BIAAK7","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Destro","lastName":"Guilherme Fernando Gomes"},{"firstName":"Andrade","lastName":" André Felipe Alves de"},{"firstName":"Fernandes","lastName":" Virgínia de"},{"firstName":"Terribile","lastName":" Levi Carina"},{"firstName":"De Marco","lastName":" Paulo"}],"title":"Climate suitability as indicative of invasion potential for the most seized bird species in Brazil","publication_title":"Journal for Nature Conservation","issn":"1617-1381","doi":"10.1016/j.jnc.2020.125890","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1617138120301369","abstract_note":"Wildlife trade is considered one of the most significant pathways for the spread of exotic species, as it is present worldwide and crosses abiotic and biotic barriers. In this sense, identifying potential invaders before they are introduced and analyzing the ecological implications of possible escapes of captive species to the wild is an important issue for preventing invasive species impacts. In Brazil, several studies have demonstrated the consequences of wildlife trade on the biogeographic patterns of some species. In this context, using the ten most seized bird species in Brazil, we seek to identify the most suitable areas for invasion of these species in all Brazilian regions, as well as in other South American countries. To this end, we used ecological niche modeling to evaluate region invasibility by the ten assessed species. In addition, natural distribution polygons and actual records were used to evaluate changes in the distribution ranges of the evaluated species. Overall, ‘Red-cowled Cardinal’, ‘Saffron Finch’, ‘Yellow-bellied Seedeater’ and ‘Rufous-collared Sparrow’ reached the highest rate of invasion in susceptible areas. Proportionally, French Guiana, Guyana and Suriname showed the highest amount of invasion potential areas in South America overall. Ecuador and Bolivia reached the highest percentage of suitable areas for four or more species. Regarding Brazil, all regions were suitable for invasion by at least three of the ten analyzed species, whereas the north and midwest were the most vulnerable regions. We discuss the need to consider the animal trade as one of the main means to promote organism translocation and cause alterations in the biogeographical patterns of several species.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"125890","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Invasivespecies","Animal trade","Animal trafficking","Ecological Niche Modeling – ENM","Ensemble","Passerine"]},{"key":"P3VTTDWA","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Fischer","lastName":"Fabian Jörg"},{"firstName":"Labrière","lastName":" Nicolas"},{"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":" Grégoire"},{"firstName":"Hérault","lastName":" Bruno"},{"firstName":"Alonso","lastName":" Alfonso"},{"firstName":"Memiaghe","lastName":" Hervé"},{"firstName":"Bissiengou","lastName":" Pulchérie"},{"firstName":"Kenfack","lastName":" David"},{"firstName":"Saatchi","lastName":" Sassan"},{"firstName":"Chave","lastName":" Jérôme"}],"title":"A simulation method to infer tree allometry and forest structure from airborne laser scanning and forest inventories","publication_title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","issn":"0034-4257","doi":"10.1016/j.rse.2020.112056","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425720304260","abstract_note":"Tropical forests are characterized by large carbon stocks and high biodiversity, but they are increasingly threatened by human activities. Since structure strongly influences the functioning and resilience of forest communities and ecosystems, it is important to quantify it at fine spatial scales. Here, we propose a new simulation-based approach, the “Canopy Constructor”, with which we quantified forest structure and biomass at two tropical forest sites, one in French Guiana, the other in Gabon. In a first step, the Canopy Constructor combines field inventories and airborne lidar scans to create virtual 3D representations of forest canopies that best fit the data. From those, it infers the forests' structure, including crown packing densities and allometric scaling relationships between tree dimensions. In a second step, the results of the first step are extrapolated to create virtual tree inventories over the whole lidar-scanned area. Across the French Guiana and Gabon plots, we reconstructed empirical canopies with a mean absolute error of 3.98 m [95% credibility interval: 3.02, 4.98], or 14.4%, and a small upwards bias of 0.66 m [−0.41, 1.8], or 2.7%. Height-stem diameter allometries were inferred with more precision than crown-stem diameter allometries, with generally larger heights at the Amazonian than the African site, but similar crown-stem diameter allometries. Plot-based aboveground biomass was inferred to be larger in French Guiana with 400.8 t ha−1 [366.2–437.9], compared to 302.2 t ha−1 in Gabon [267.8–336.8] and decreased to 299.8 t ha−1 [275.9–333.9] and 251.8 t ha−1 [206.7–291.7] at the landscape scale, respectively. Predictive accuracy of the extrapolation procedure had an RMSE of 53.7 t ha−1 (14.9%) at the 1 ha scale and 87.6 t ha−1 (24.2%) at the 0.25 ha scale, with a bias of −17.1 t ha−1 (−4.7%). This accuracy was similar to regression-based approaches, but the Canopy Constructor improved the representation of natural heterogeneity considerably, with its range of biomass estimates larger by 54% than regression-based estimates. The Canopy Constructor is a comprehensive inference procedure that provides fine-scale and individual-based reconstructions even in dense tropical forests. It may thus prove vital in the assessment and monitoring of those forests, and has the potential for a wider applicability, for example in the exploration of ecological and physiological relationships in space or the initialisation and calibration of forest growth models.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"112056","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biomass","Tropical forest","Vegetation structure","Allometry","Airborne lidar","Approximate Bayesian Computation","Canopy space filling","Individual-based modeling"]},{"key":"87PN5UYY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Sales","lastName":"Naiara Guimarães"},{"firstName":"Wangensteen","lastName":" Owen Simon"},{"firstName":"Carvalho","lastName":" Daniel Cardoso"},{"firstName":"Deiner","lastName":" Kristy"},{"firstName":"Præbel","lastName":" Kim"},{"firstName":"Coscia","lastName":" Ilaria"},{"firstName":"McDevitt","lastName":" Allan D."},{"firstName":"Mariani","lastName":" Stefano"}],"title":"Space-time dynamics in monitoring neotropical fish communities using eDNA metabarcoding","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142096","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720356254","abstract_note":"The biodiverse Neotropical ecoregion remains insufficiently assessed, poorly managed, and threatened by unregulated human activities.

Here, we evaluate the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding for assessing the structure and distribution of fish communities by analysing water and sediment from 11 locations along the Jequitinhonha River catchment (Brazil). Each site was sampled twice, before and after a major rain event in a five-week period and fish diversity was estimated using high-throughput sequencing of 12S rRNA amplicons. In total, 252 Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) and 34 fish species were recovered, including endemic, introduced, and previously unrecorded species for this basin. Spatio-temporal variation of eDNA from fish assemblages was observed and species richness was nearly twice as high before the major rain event compared to afterwards. Yet, peaks of diversity were primarily associated with only four of the locations. No correlation between β-diversity and longitudinal distance or presence of dams was detected, but low species richness observed at sites located near dams might that these anthropogenic barriers may have an impact on local fish diversity. Unexpectedly high α-diversity levels recorded at the river mouth suggest that these sections should be further evaluated as putative “eDNA reservoirs” for rapid monitoring. By uncovering spatio-temporal changes, unrecorded biodiversity components, and putative anthropogenic impacts on fish assemblages, we further strengthen the potential of eDNA metabarcoding as a biomonitoring tool, especially in regions often neglected or difficult to access.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:53:13","pages":"142096","language":"en","automatic_tags":["eDNA","Brazil","River","Biodiversity assessment","Fish","Freshwater"]},{"key":"JETHGRP7","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Bonilla-Aldana","lastName":"D.

Little is known about resistance to drying stress and the underpinning traits in Neotropical freshwater species, so we don’t know whether desiccation resistance allows to anticipate shifts in biological diversity under future climate scenarios. Here, we used the aquatic invertebrates that live in the rainwater-filled leaves of tank bromeliads, to examine the extent to which desiccation resistance of species measured in the laboratory predicts community response to drought intensification in nature. We measured desiccation resistance in 17 invertebrate species (>90% of the biomass usually found in bromeliads of French Guiana) by recording the median lethal time (LT50) of experimental populations exposed to controlled conditions of residual moisture. In the field, we placed rainshelters above tank bromeliads to emulate drought scenarios ranging from the ambient norm to IPCC scenarios and extreme events, and we recorded the response of functional community structure. LT50 ranged from 4.18 to 19.06 days, and was related to cuticle content and dry body mass. Among other functional indicators that represent strategies to optimize resource use under stressful conditions (e.g., habitat use, trophic specialization), LT50 was the best predictor of community structure responses along a gradient of emulated drought intensities. Therefore, species’ LT50s measured under laboratory conditions can be used to forecast aquatic community response to drying stress in nature. Anticipating how species will cope with drought has never been more important for environmental managers to support climate change adaptation. We show that desiccation resistance in freshwater invertebrates is a key indicator of potential population size and local–global range shifts, and this could be especially true in the Neotropics where species have narrow physiological tolerances for climatic variation.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"106839","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Rainforests","Functional traits","LT50","Macroinvertebrates"]},{"key":"AFLUPAZS","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wen"},{"firstName":"Dai","lastName":" Zhijun"},{"firstName":"Pang","lastName":" Wenhong"},{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":" Jie"},{"firstName":"Gao","lastName":" Shu"}],"title":"Sedimentary zonation shift of tidal flats in a meso-tidal estuary","publication_title":"Sedimentary Geology","issn":"0037-0738","doi":"10.1016/j.sedgeo.2020.105749","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0037073820301640","abstract_note":"Understanding the spatial-temporal pattern of sedimentary dynamics on tidal flats is important for examining their ecological function and evolutionary trend. In this study, the dynamic state of sediments across an open-coast tidal flat of the meso-tidal Changjiang Estuary, China, on a monthly scale from December 2014 to June 2016 was examined, based on a high-spatial-resolution sedimentological-topographic survey and a collection of related meteorological-hydrological data. The results revealed a continuously distinct zonation of sediments, which transformed seaward from sand-dominance to silt dominance over a short distance. A zoning, to divide the tidal flat into a sand zone, a mixture zone and a silt zone, was delimited based on the cluster analysis of grain size frequency distributions. The zonation was highly dynamic, with the mixture zone migrating upward during summer and experiencing an uplift of 1 m in its lower boundary over the time period examined. Within each zone, the medium size and sorting coefficient of sediments tended to be smaller in winter than those in summer. Alterations of the mean tidal level likely controlled the zonation shift and sediment variations. A higher mean tidal level indicated a landward shift of the location exhibiting shear stress maxima and the mixture zone had to migrate upward to maintain an appropriate stress for the development of mixed sediments. The impacts of waves were masked under normal conditions, but during storms strong waves dominated an embedded downward displacement of the mixture zone. Characteristics of sediments covering a large region of the tidal flat changed along with zonation shifts, resulting from altered proportions among sandy, mixed and silty sediments. The study highlights that sedimentary zonation shift, under the impacts of seasonal variations in tidal level, can be a major manifestation of tidal flat sedimentary dynamics.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"105749","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Sediment","Changjiang Estuary","Grain size","Tidal flat","Zonation shift"]},{"key":"KQW34HYN","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Murphy","lastName":"M.

Since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Caribbean on 1st March 2020, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been widely used to control the resulting COVID-19 outbreak. We document the variety of government measures introduced across the Caribbean and explore their impact on aspects of outbreak control. Methods Drawing on publically available information, we present confirmed cases and confirmed deaths to describe the extent of the Caribbean outbreak. We document the range of outbreak containment measures implemented by national Governments, focussing on measures to control movement and gatherings. We explore the temporal association of containment measures with the start of the outbreak in each country, and with aggregated information on human movement, using smartphone positioning data. We include a set of comparator countries to provide an international context. Results As of 25th May, the Caribbean reported 18,755 confirmed cases and 631 deaths. There have been broad similarities but also variation in the number, the type, the intensity, and particularly the timing of the NPIs introduced across the Caribbean. On average, Caribbean governments began controlling movement into countries 27 days before their first confirmed case and 23 days before comparator countries. Controls on movement within country were introduced 9 days after the first case and 36 days before comparators. Controls on gatherings were implemented 1 day before the first confirmed case and 30 days before comparators. Confirmed case growth rates and numbers of deaths have remained low across much the Caribbean. Stringent Caribbean curfews and stay-at-home orders coincided with large reductions in community mobility, regularly above 60%, and higher than most international comparator countries. Conclusion Stringent controls to limit movement, and specifically the early timing of those controls has had an important impact on containing the spread of COVID-19 across much of the Caribbean. Very early controls to limit movement into countries may well be particularly effective for small island developing states. With much of the region economically reliant on international tourism, and with steps to open borders now being implemented, it is critical that the region draws on a solid evidence-base to balance the competing demands of economic wellbeing and public health.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"100019","language":"en","automatic_tags":["COVID-19","Mobility","Non pharmaceutical interventions","Small island developing states"]},{"key":"U6FC9HBZ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"NyassokeTiti","lastName":" Gaston Clément"},{"firstName":"Sadefo Kamdem","lastName":" Jules"},{"firstName":"Fono","lastName":" Louis Aimé"}],"title":"Fishery management in a regime switching environment: Utility theory approach","publication_title":"Results in Applied Mathematics","issn":"2590-0374","doi":"10.1016/j.rinam.2020.100125","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590037420300352","abstract_note":"In this paper, we study the problem of optimal fishing for regime switching in the growth dynamics of a given fish species which is described by the differential stochastic logistic model with two states: prior or during floods and after.

Depending on retinal location, this condition may cause substantial vision impairment. T. gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite, with both sexual and asexual life cycles, and infection is typically contracted orally by consuming encysted bradyzoites in undercooked meat, or oocysts on unwashed garden produce or in contaminated water. Presently available anti-parasitic drugs cannot eliminate T. gondii from the body. In vitro studies using T. gondii tachyzoites, and human retinal cells and tissue have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of ocular toxoplasmosis. T. gondii may cross the vascular endothelium to access human retina by at least three routes: in leukocyte taxis; as a transmigrating tachyzoite; and after infecting endothelial cells. The parasite is capable of navigating the human neuroretina, gaining access to a range of cell populations. Retinal Müller glial cells are preferred initial host cells. T. gondii infection of the retinal pigment epithelial cells alters the secretion of growth factors and induces proliferation of adjacent uninfected epithelial cells. This increases susceptibility of the cells to parasite infection, and may be the basis of the characteristic hyperpigmented toxoplasmic retinal lesion. Infected epithelial cells also generate a vigorous immunologic response, and influence the activity of leukocytes that infiltrate the retina. A range of T. gondii genotypes are associated with human ocular toxoplasmosis, and individual immunogenetics –including polymorphisms in genes encoding innate immune receptors, human leukocyte antigens and cytokines– impacts the clinical manifestations. Research into basic pathogenic mechanisms of ocular toxoplasmosis highlights the importance of prevention and suggests new biological drug targets for established disease.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"100882","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Eye","Human","Retina","Toxoplasma","Toxoplasmosis"]},{"key":"QNIW6XRF","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Branfireun","lastName":"Brian A."},{"firstName":"Cosio","lastName":" Claudia"},{"firstName":"Poulain","lastName":" Alexandre J."},{"firstName":"Riise","lastName":" Gunnhild"},{"firstName":"Bravo","lastName":" Andrea G."}],"title":"Mercury cycling in freshwater systems - An updated conceptual model","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140906","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720344351","abstract_note":"The widely accepted conceptual model of mercury (Hg) cycling in freshwater lakes (atmospheric deposition and runoff of inorganic Hg, methylation in bottom sediments and subsequent bioaccumulation and biomagnification in biota) is practically accepted as common knowledge.

Anthropic changes in the natural environments are the major drivers of massive deforestation and local climate change, with serious impacts on the dynamics of mosquito communities and on the risk of acquiring malaria. Considering the lack of information on the dynamics of malaria transmission in areas across the Atlantic Forest biome, where Ke. cruzii is the dominant vector, and the impact of climate drivers of malaria, the present study aimed to: (i) investigate the occurrence and survival rate of Ke. cruzii based on the distinct vegetation profiles found in areas across the coastal region of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome; (ii) estimate the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and survival rates of P. vivax and P. falciparum parasites in Ke. cruzii under current and future scenarios. The potential distribution of Plasmodium spp. was estimated using simulation analyses under distinct scenarios of average temperature increases from 1 °C to 3.7 °C. Our results showed that two conditions are necessary to explain the occurrence and survival of Ke. cruzii: warm temperature and presence of the Atlantic Forest biome. Moreover, both Plasmodium species showed a tendency to decrease their EIP and increase their estimated survival rates in a scenario of higher temperature. Our findings support that the high-risk malaria areas may include the southern region of the distribution range of the Atlantic Forest biome in the coming years. Despite its limitations and assumptions, the present study provides robust evidence of areas with potential to be impacted by malaria incidence in a future scenario. These areas should be monitored in the next decades regarding the occurrence of the mosquito vector and the potential for malaria persistence and increased occurrence.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"104456","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mosquito","Bromeliad-malaria","Extrinsic incubation period"]},{"key":"LZHCG29V","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Swart","lastName":"Rudi C."},{"firstName":"Samways","lastName":" Michael J."},{"firstName":"Pryke","lastName":" James S."},{"firstName":"Roets","lastName":" Francois"}],"title":"Overhead tree canopy species has limited effect on leaf litter decomposition and decomposer communities in a floristically diverse, southern temperate rainforest","publication_title":"Applied Soil Ecology","issn":"0929-1393","doi":"10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.103700","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139320306296","abstract_note":"To decipher the <30% of unexplained variation in leaf litter decomposition, a process important for nutrient cycling yet vulnerable to rising CO2 levels, numerous hypotheses have been proposed. The home-field advantage (HFA) hypothesis states that leaf litter decomposes more rapidly beneath canopies of tree species from which the leaves originate (home environment), than beneath other tree species. Most HFA studies typically involve reciprocal litter transplants between habitat types (i.e. forest vs. grassland) or successional stages (i.e. early vs. late). The mixed and often conflicting results pertaining to this hypothesis, mostly assessed at the landscape-level, merit a finer scale analysis of decomposition variability, i.e. at the tree species level. Despite homogenous litter build up close to any given tree individual in a mixed forest, along with evidence of varying decomposition rates under different tree species, we still lack basic understanding of forest floor decomposition dynamics at the tree species level, strongly driven by host selection by fungi as well as arthropod detritivores. To address these gaps, we first determined differences in decomposition rates between leaves of three dominant forest tree species. We then compared decomposition rates between leaf litter placed beneath the canopies of source species vs. non-source species in a mixed-tree natural, temperate rainforest, accounting for the activity of both fungi (microbiota) and arthropod detritivores (both meso- and macrofauna). We found that leaf-litter decomposition rates can differ significantly depending on the source-tree species. Despite this, we found no effect of overhead tree species on decomposition rates of leaf litter, irrespective whether under source species or non-source species. Only one species' leaf litter showed differences in arthropod diversity between leaf litter placed beneath source tree species vs. non-source species, with higher arthropod diversity in leaf litter placed beneath source trees. Also, arthropods here contributed significantly more than fungi to overall decomposition. However, bacteria (not measured here) may also have decomposed litter greatly, with litter loss not solely due to our focal groups. We conclude that, in a single, diverse forest, perhaps due to differences in litter fall rate and nutrient content of leaf litter, only some plant species might reveal small-scale patterns for detritivore diversity, with yet unknown effects overall decomposition. As such, landscape-level studies on decomposition should incorporate and account for the effects of tree species-level decomposition variability.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"103700","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Afrotemperate","Detritivore","Home-field advantage","Tree-arthropod interactions"]},{"key":"SZRVSLCM","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Almeira","lastName":"J."}],"title":"Application of a sample space for the characterization of shaded coffee plantation soundscape","publication_title":"Ecological Informatics","issn":"1574-9541","doi":"10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101120","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954120300704","abstract_note":"The plot of the frequencies that build soundscapes (power spectrum) has been used to show some of their distinctive characteristics.

This study aims to present a Statistical, inherent Optical property (IOP) -based, and muLti-conditional Inversion proceDure (SOLID) for enhanced retrievals of satellite-derived TSS under a wide range of in-water bio-optical conditions in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters. In this study, using a large in situ database (N > 3500), the SOLID model is devised using a three-step procedure: (a) water-type classification of the input remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), (b) retrieval of particulate backscattering (bbp) in the red or near-infrared (NIR) regions using semi-analytical, machine-learning, and empirical models, and (c) estimation of TSS from bbp via water-type-specific empirical models. Using an independent subset of our in situ data (N = 2729) with TSS ranging from 0.1 to 2626.8 [g/m3], the SOLID model is thoroughly examined and compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms (Miller and McKee, 2004; Nechad et al., 2010; Novoa et al., 2017; Ondrusek et al., 2012; Petus et al., 2010). We show that SOLID outperforms all the other models to varying degrees, i.e.,from 10 to >100%, depending on the statistical attributes (e.g., global versus water-type-specific metrics). For demonstration purposes, the model is implemented for images acquired by the MultiSpectral Imager aboard Sentinel-2A/B over the Chesapeake Bay, San-Francisco-Bay-Delta Estuary, Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Taihu. To enable generating consistent, multimission TSS products, its performance is further extended to, and evaluated for, other missions, such as the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Sensitivity analyses on uncertainties induced by the atmospheric correction indicate that 10% uncertainty in Rrs leads to <20% uncertainty in TSS retrievals from SOLID. While this study suggests that SOLID has a potential for producing TSS products in global coastal and inland waters, our statistical analysis certainly verifies that there is still a need for improving retrievals across a wide spectrum of particle loads.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"111768","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Aquaticremote sensing","Backscattering","Coastal and inland waters","Inherent optical properties","Inversion models","Remote sensing reflectance","Sentinel-3","Total suspended solids"]},{"key":"N3S386ZS","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2021","author":[{"firstName":"Mertikas","lastName":"Stelios P."},{"firstName":"Donlon","lastName":" Craig"},{"firstName":"Matsakis","lastName":" Demetrios"},{"firstName":"Mavrocordatos","lastName":" Constantin"},{"firstName":"Altamimi","lastName":" Zuheir"},{"firstName":"Kokolakis","lastName":" Costas"},{"firstName":"Tripolitsiotis","lastName":" Achilles"}],"title":"Fiducial reference systems for time and coordinates in satellite altimetry","publication_title":"Advances in Space Research","issn":"0273-1177","doi":"10.1016/j.asr.2020.05.014","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117720303379","abstract_note":"Time is the fundamental measurement in satellite altimetry and the key parameter in building and keeping up a long-term, consistent, and reliable record for monitoring changes in sea level. Over the years, different time scales, although interconnected, have been used in altimetry and also in satellite positioning. This sometimes leads to inexplicit descriptions and ambiguous use of time and orbit coordinates as well as of their transformations between various reference and measuring systems. Altimetry satellites, like Sentinel-3, CryoSat-2, Jason-3, HY-2A/-2B, IceSat-2, etc., observe and practically realize ranges by measuring time differences between the transmission and reception of an electromagnetic wave (either radar or laser at present). Similar principles apply for global navigation satellite systems and for their terrestrial reference systems upon which altimetry is linked and tied together. Yet, the “meter” of any terrestrial reference systems is also defined by time. This work seeks to establish a standard reference system for “time” and “coordinates” in an effort to reach uniform and absolute standardization for satellite altimetry. It describes various errors generated from differences, discontinuities and interactions in time, frequency, range, time tagging, and reference coordinate frames. A new approach, called “fiducial reference measurements for altimetry”, is here given to examine ways to connect errors with metrology standards in order to improve the estimation of uncertainty budgets in ocean and water level observation by altimetry. Finally, the geocentric inertial reference system and the international atomic time are proposed in this paper for satellite altimetry observations and products.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"1140-1160","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Coordinates","Fiducial reference measurements","Reference systems","Satellite altimetry","Time reference"]},{"key":"A337NRBB","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Jing"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":" Dedi"},{"firstName":"Detto","lastName":" Matteo"},{"firstName":"Nelson","lastName":" Bruce W."},{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":" Min"},{"firstName":"Guan","lastName":" Kaiyu"},{"firstName":"Wu","lastName":" Shengbiao"},{"firstName":"Yan","lastName":" Zhengbing"},{"firstName":"Wu","lastName":" Jin"}],"title":"Multi-scale integration of satellite remote sensing improves characterization of dry-season green-up in an Amazon tropical evergreen forest","publication_title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","issn":"0034-4257","doi":"10.1016/j.rse.2020.111865","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425720302352","abstract_note":"In tropical forests, leaf phenology—particularly the pronounced dry-season green-up—strongly regulates biogeochemical cycles of carbon and water fluxes. However, uncertainties remain in the understanding of tropical forest leaf phenology at different spatial scales. Phenocams accurately characterize leaf phenology at the crown and ecosystem scales but are limited to a few sites and time spans of a few years. Time-series satellite observations might fill this gap, but the commonly used satellites (e.g. MODIS, Landsat and Sentinel-2) have resolutions too coarse to characterize single crowns. To resolve this observational challenge, we used the PlanetScope constellation with a 3 m resolution and near daily nadir-view coverage. We first developed a rigorous method to cross-calibrate PlanetScope surface reflectance using daily BRDF-adjusted MODIS as the reference. We then used linear spectral unmixing of calibrated PlanetScope to obtain dry-season change in the fractional cover of green vegetation (GV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) at the PlanetScope pixel level. We used the Central Amazon Tapajos National Forest k67 site, as all necessary data (from field to phenocam and satellite observations) was available. For this proof of concept, we chose a set of 22 dates of PlanetScope measurements in 2018 and 16 in 2019, all from the six drier months of the year to provide the highest possible cloud-free temporal resolution. Our results show that MODIS-calibrated dry-season PlanetScope data (1) accurately assessed seasonal changes in ecosystem-scale and crown-scale spectral reflectance; (2) detected an increase in ecosystem-scale GV fraction (and a decrease in NPV fraction) from June to November of both years, consistent with local phenocam observations with R2 around 0.8; and (3) monitored large seasonal trend variability in crown-scale NPV fraction. Our results highlight the potential of integrating multi-scale satellite observations to extend fine-scale leaf phenology monitoring beyond the spatial limits of phenocams.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"111865","language":"en","automatic_tags":["MODIS","BRDF correction","Individual tree crowns","Leaf phenology","Multi-scale satellite observations","Non-photosynthetic vegetation","PlanetScope","Reflectance cross-calibration"]},{"key":"3DIP94HC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Keppeler","lastName":"Friedrich Wofgang"},{"firstName":"Hallwass","lastName":" Gustavo"},{"firstName":"Santos","lastName":" Franciele"},{"firstName":"da Silva","lastName":" Luís Henrique Tomazzoni"},{"firstName":"Silvano","lastName":" Renato Azevedo Matias"}],"title":"What makes a good catch?

The increased erosion of mangrove coastlines leads to mangrove degradation and loss of ecosystem services. However, to map the extent of erosion and progradation in dynamic landscapes is often time and data consuming and challenging to perform at a large scale. This study uses cloud computing-based remote sensing analysis in Google Earth Engine to map the extent of mangrove shoreline dynamics in two contrasting hotspots: the Sundarbans mangrove complex across India and Bangladesh, and the coast of French Guiana. Mapping was performed between 1984 and 2018 using available data on mangrove distribution and surface water change, classifying change of states as permanent, seasonal and ephemeral. Between 1984 and 2018, erosion and progradation accounted for 24.55% and 12.52% of total change, respectively. Contrastingly, in French Guiana erosion and progradation accounted for 9.53% and 4.48% of total change, respectively. The Sundarbans experienced more permanent changes as compared to French Guiana. The permanent loss of mangrove forests in the Sundarbans can be attributed to the reduction in sediment supply and the temporary loss in French Guiana to cyclical patterns of migrating mudbanks. The methods presented in this study performed with an overall accuracy above 90% in different settings of both the case studies. This study provides an important baseline of mangrove erosion and progradation extent and an improved method to analyse coastal dynamics in mangrove landscapes.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"106798","language":"en","automatic_tags":["coastalaccretion","coastal erosion","Google Earth Engine","mangrove loss","water classification"]},{"key":"TCL2GB8R","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Go","lastName":"Sujung"},{"firstName":"Kim","lastName":" Jhoon"},{"firstName":"Mok","lastName":" Jungbin"},{"firstName":"Irie","lastName":" Hitoshi"},{"firstName":"Yoon","lastName":" Jongmin"},{"firstName":"Torres","lastName":" Omar"},{"firstName":"Krotkov","lastName":" Nickolay A."},{"firstName":"Labow","lastName":" Gordon"},{"firstName":"Kim","lastName":" Mijin"},{"firstName":"Koo","lastName":" Ja-Ho"},{"firstName":"Choi","lastName":" Myungje"},{"firstName":"Lim","lastName":" Hyunkwang"}],"title":"Ground-based retrievals of aerosol column absorption in the UV spectral region and their implications for GEMS measurements","publication_title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","issn":"0034-4257","doi":"10.1016/j.rse.2020.111759","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425720301292","abstract_note":"Quantifying the spectral variation of column aerosol absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) wavelengths is required for accurate satellite-based aerosol and trace-gas retrievals.

During the 23 month study (2016–2018) thermal stratification limited CO2 emission, in part from photosynthetic uptake of CO2, from early April to late October, while mixing processes stimulated CO2 emission of CO2 generated from organic matter remineralization in bottom water from October to April. The Dalongdong reservoir is an atmospheric source of CO2 for most of the study period; however, during periods of stratification, approximately 0.37 ± 0.44 Gg CO2 (1 Gg = 109g) dissolved into the water from the atmosphere, while approximately 6.24 ± 3.73 Gg CO2 was lost to the atmosphere during periods lacking stratification.

Due to the extreme humanitarian situation, the effects on the environment have been overlooked. However, due to the intense fighting, the impacts will be dramatic and produce an environmental disaster. The war is already affecting areas beyond Ukraine (explosions in Russia and Moldova territory). This discussion paper aims to shed light on the potential effect of this vast conflict on the ecosystems and their services. Although the war is still ongoing, there is evidence of severe air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the intense fights. Also, warfare activities were conducted in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (the biggest in Europe) and Chernobyl, increasing the fear of radiation leaks. The biodiversity is being drastically affected due to intense deforestation and habitat destruction with potential implications for wildlife. Bombing, trench and tunnel excavations will likely negatively impact soil degradation and landscape morphology. This assumes particular importance since Ukraine has some of the most fertile soils globally (Chernozem), affecting food production. Water availability and quality are likely to be affected due to infrastructure destruction and the transport of pollutants to water reserves. The ecosystem services supplied will likely be strongly damaged since deforestation will decrease the capacity of the ecosystems to regulate air pollution or climate. Soil degradation will hamper food production, and landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage and social cohesion destruction drastically affects cultural services. Finally, the impacts on human health are already tremendous. However, it can be even higher due to exposure to high levels of contamination and sanitary conditions degradation. The war is still ongoing, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the impacts. However, we may expect a dramatic effect on the total environment. Soil conservation service (SCS), one of the vital ecosystem services, represents the ecosystem’s capacity to conserve soil and control erosion. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires multidisciplinary efforts in which SCS plays a key role. However, the coupling analysis of SCS and the SDGs is lacking. We analysed SCS’s contribution to the SDGs by a case study in China and a global expert questionnaire and explored systematic strategies to improve SCS implementation. The results showed that i) SCS ensures the SDG achievement by mitigating soil erosion; ii) SCS showed a significant and positive relationship (coef. = 0.41, p < 0.01) with SDG 15 (Life on land) in China. Moreover, SCS supports multiple SDGs by regulating ecological processes, producing food and products, and providing social and cultural values. More than 50% of respondents recognised that SCS benefits SDG 15, SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation). Finally, to be goal-oriented, we presented an SDG-holistic guiding framework to promote SCS for the SDG achievement, thus harnessing the SCS’s roles in social, economic, and eco-environmental sustainability. Altogether, our work highlights the associations between the SDGs and SCS, which is key to recognising the contribution of soils and ESs to sustainable development. The replacement of dominant sedges/grasses with secondary forbs is common in alpine rangelands, but the underlying plant ecological strategies and their relevance to leaf traits and their variabilities of different plant functional groups remain largely unknown. Here, we measured key leaf traits and analyzed the competitor, stress-tolerator and ruderal (CSR) strategies of major species with different functional groups (sedges, grasses and forbs) in an alpine meadow along a degradation gradient on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicated that S-selected species were dominant in both non-degraded (C:S:R = 1:95:4%) and severely degraded (C:S:R = 2:87:11%) meadows. However, there was a shift from S- to R-strategy in the communities after rangeland degradation. More specifically, sedges and grasses with a “conservative” strategy maintained stronger S-strategy to tolerate degraded and stressful conditions. In contrast, forbs with an “opportunistic” strategy (increase 9.5% in R-score) tended to adapt to degraded stages. Moreover, 51.1% and 23.9% of the increased R-scores in forbs were accounted by leaf mass per area and specific leaf area, respectively. Generally, higher leaf water and nitrogen contents coupled with larger variations in leaf traits and flexible SR strategies in forbs enabled them to capitalize on lower soil water and nutrient availability. Our findings highlighted that the contrasting strategies of plant species in response to the decrease in available resources might lead to niche expansion of secondary forbs and loss of diversity in the degraded alpine meadow. The emerging alternative stable states in the degraded rangelands might bring about a predicament for rangeland restoration. Global promotion of decarbonisation by using sustainable bio-renewables is associated with generation of ash residues whose amounts have increased exponentially in the last decades. Bioashes are physicochemically complex, ultra-alkaline, and potentially hazardous solids, but with a huge potential to become (co)products with environmental/economic value. Their diverse nature lends itself to a wide range of uses in land remediation, wastewater treatment, civil and bio-tech engineering, end even medicine. However, there are issues hindering the usage of bioashes as valuable resources: i) large variation among specific fractions and types, ii) strong and long-lasting reactivity and potential toxicity, and iii) an incoherent, often non-existent, legislative and regulatory framework for management of specific bio-wastes. Overcoming these obstacles and uncertainties regarding the ecological and economic benefits vs. negative side-effects is a significant challenge. The research and implementation work is urgently needed to i) elucidate dosage-dependent biological outcomes of bioash amendments, especially those related to soil and aquatic microbiomes as the primary living barriers/biofilters for most substances released from bioashes, and ii) transform finely powdered matrices to easy-to-apply forms (from nano/micro-to mm-sized agglomerates) to reduce human health implications. The continued progress in material sciences and nanotechnology offers a fascinating array of solutions for re-purposing bioashes; however, given the stringent quality-demanding criteria, the separation and concentration of targeted submatrices (e.g. aluminosilicates) from the bulk bioashes are yet to be achieved on the lab to industrial scales. Meanwhile, a significant reuse potential of bioashes will remain under-exploited and compounded by the adverse environmental issues arising from landfill disposal. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical indicator for healthy and fertile lands across the world. It is also the planet's largest terrestrial carbon pool, so any changes of this pool may have profound implications for both land productivity and climate stability. However, SOC changes have so far remained largely unexplored, although their understanding is essential for many international environmental policies. Here we investigate for the first time recent global SOC changes, based on some SOC stock interannual data that were processed for the 2001–2015 period on a planetary scale. We analysed the global SOC dynamics using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator, which are widely acknowledged to be reliable geostatistical tools for detecting various environmental trends from global to local scale. We explored SOC changes via three metrics (averages, quantities, areas) of negative and positive trends, but also of the balance between soil carbon trends, a key statistic for monitoring land quality stability and soil–atmosphere carbon fluxes in the global environmental policies. Globally, we estimated a net average decrease of −58.6 t C km2 yr−1, a total loss of ~3.1 Pg C, and an area affected by net SOC losses of ~1.9 million km2. Using this triple statistic, we found that 79% of countries worldwide have been affected by net declines of SOC after 2001, which suggests that halting land degradation and mitigating climate change through the SOC pathway are still far from being achieved by international policies. Land degradation has become one of the biggest environmental challenges human society is currently facing, which is why understanding the global pattern of this land crisis is absolutely necessary. However, so far, the multiple forms of this environmental issue have mainly been analysed in international scientific literature in a narrow traditional manner, frequently based on approaching a relatively low number of ordinary land degradation processes. Consequently, as this complex process has not been sufficiently well explored, this study aims to investigate global land degradation in an interdisciplinary and holistic manner, in terms of the multidimensional nature, causes, spatial footprint, multiple consequences (for the ecological and anthropogenic systems worldwide, but also for the global climate system) and various solutions to mitigate worldwide land multi-degradation. Based on various information investigated in more than 500 reliable scientific papers, the findings of this review paper showed that there currently are 17 land degradation pathways (aridity, biological invasions, coastal erosion, land erosion by water, land erosion by wind, land pollution, land subsidence, landslides, permafrost thawing, salinization, soil acidification, soil biodiversity loss, soil compaction, soil organic carbon loss, soil sealing, vegetation degradation and waterlogging), which are active on various spatial scales across the planet. Five of the seventeen land degradation dimensions were considered major land degradation pathways and explored in detail in this study (aridity, land erosion by water, salinization, soil organic carbon loss and vegetation degradation), considering several relevant criteria outlined in the paper (global spatial footprint, data availability, and impact on agricultural, ecological and climate systems). Essentially, it was found that the five global degradation processes significantly erode the multiple ecosystem functions and services of worldwide land systems, which are crucial for human wellbeing, life support and the Earth systems’ stability. Nonetheless, other land degradation processes can also be considered major land degradative pathways, although a main current impediment in their detailed investigation is the general lack of global data availability. Therefore, the study highlights the complexity and severity of global land degradation, and draws attention to the need for other studies to approach land degradation multidimensionally, which goes beyond the traditional perspectives focused on the conventional processes of water erosion, wind erosion or soil salinization. At the same time, the study highlights the fact that land degradation must be an urgent priority in governmental and international policies, which can rely on a wide range of control measures that are currently available (some of the relevant ones are explored in this paper) for combating this disrupting environmental process rapidly, efficiently and on a large scale throughout the world. Marine litter affects marine organisms, posing threats to biodiversity conservation and to ecosystem structure and functioning. Providing a suitable assessment of marine litter effects on marine life through bioindicator species is crucial to drive an effective waste management policy. However, to date no standardized tool has been developed to describe and monitor the impact of marine macro-litter on marine life within deep-water habitats. Modifying the protocol proposed to monitor macro-litter ingestion by the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta, we perform a preliminary investigation on the suitability of different elasmobranch species for monitoring macro-litter ingestion in deep-sea. A total of 122 specimens representing 7 elasmobranch species were collected and examined. External visual inspections documented no clear evidences of disease due to marine litter entanglement. A total of 7 ingested litter items were found in the stomach or in the esophagus of 6 specimens of 4 different species (frequency of occurrence = 4.9%), with a maximum number of 2 items per specimen. No litter items were found in the intestinal contents, as well as no evidence of gastrointestinal blockages due to litter items were detected. The low number of collected litter items suggests that the number of samples required is too large for a feasible monitoring program. Moreover, we observed that the anatomy of the intestinal spiral valve may represent an obstacle to the transit of macro-litter items, which could be spontaneously regurgitated as it happens in the selective elimination of undigested remains, such as bones and scales. Therefore, macro-litter retention time in the gastrointestinal tract of elasmobranchs could be brief and shorter than retention time of food. This may lead to an underestimation of macro-litter ingestion frequency by deep-water elasmobranchs. This study reports the first evidence of plastic ingestion by the kitefin shark Dalatias licha. Epidemiological studies highlighted the possibility that exposure to cyanotoxins leads to the development of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We devised a population-based case-control study in two Italian populations. We used residential proximity of the residence to water bodies as a measure of possible exposure to cyanotoxins. Based on 703 newly-diagnosed ALS cases and 2737 controls, we calculated an ALS odds ratio (OR) of 1.41 (95% CI: 0.72–2.74) for current residence in the vicinity of water bodies, and a slightly lower estimate for historical residence (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 0.57–2.99). Subjects <65 years and people living in the Northern Italy province of Modena had higher ORs, especially when historical residence was considered. Overall, despite some risk of bias due to exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding, our results appear to support the hypothesis that cyanotoxin exposure may increase ALS risk. Previous works have made great progress in mapping and assessing ecosystem services (ES) that are directed toward exploring various aspects of ecological changes and economic values. These preferences, however, may neglect the important role of people who are the direct beneficiaries in this ecosystem. Therefore, including these stakeholders in ES assessment identifies their relations and perceptions between ecosystem services and society. In order to quantify and map these relations and perceptions, we designed and implemented an analytical framework based on the Public Participatory Geographic Information System (PPGIS) method to explore local stakeholders’ (Farmers, Government managers/Experts, and Company employees) similarities and differences in recognition of preferences and social values for ecosystem services in a typical Karst basin. Our results showed that remarkable differences appeared in preferences for ES across three groups. Farmers gave more preferences to provisioning services, Government managers/Experts to regulating and cultural services, and Company employees’ preferences were individualized. The spatial distributions and relations of social values for ES also showed great differentials. Provisioning services were always related to specific natural conditions, regulating services to forests, and cultural services to specific locations around tourism localities, forest, and wetland parks. The three stakeholder groups perceived more synergies than tradeoffs between the different ecosystem services. Landscape beauty was the most influential service in Farmers’ and Company employees’ perceptions, while Local climate change regulation was the most influential service in those of Government managers/Experts. The local stakeholders’ surveys can improve the enthusiasm of the local people to participate in environmental management and provide more socio-ecological information to help the managers alleviate the conflicts among different stakeholders. Spring grassland fires are common in boreal areas as a consequence of slash and burn agriculture used to remove dry grass to increase soil nutrient properties and crop production. However, few works have investigated fire impacts on these grassland ecosystems, especially in the immediate period after the fire. The objective of this work was to study the short-term impacts of a spring grassland fire in Lithuania. Four days after the fire we established a 400 m2 sampling grid within the burned area and in an adjacent unburned area with the same topographical, hydrological and pedological characteristics. We collected topsoil samples immediately after the fire (0 months), 2, 5, 7 and 9 months after the fire. We analysed soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), major nutrients including calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and potassium (K), and the minor elements aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). We also calculated the soil Na and K adsorption ratio (SPAR), Ca:Mg and Ca:Al. The results showed that this low-severity grassland fire significantly decreased soil pH, Al, and Mn but increased EC, Ca, Mg, and K,. There was no effect on Na, Fe, and Zn. There was a decrease of EC, Ca, Mg, and Na from 0 months after the fire until 7 months after the fire, with an increase during the last sampling period. Fire did not significantly affect SPAR. Ca:Mg decreased significantly immediately after the fire, but not to critical levels. Ca:Al increased after the fire, reducing the potential effects of Al on plants. Overall, fire impacts were mainly limited to the immediate period after the fire. There has been the recognition that trans-national binding legal agreements related to soils are very difficult to achieve, given the sensitivities related to national sovereignty in relation to land and soils. However, the Soil Thematic Strategy played an important role to raise the awareness of soil importance, integrate soils in different policy areas (agriculture, climate change, SDGs), develop research findings and finally increase our know how on European Soils. The Soil Thematic Strategy continue to be the main policy instrument dedicated to foster soil protection in the European Union (EU). The EU consider the importance of soils and land degradation taking into account global challenges such as the sustainable production intensification, food security, climate change and escalating population growth. During the last decade both the 7th Framework Programme for Research (FP7) and the HORIZON2020 financed research and innovation projects for advancing soil protection and better understanding of soil management in EU. The assessment of Ecosystem Health (EH) is crucial for effective ecosystem services (ES) management and global environmental change assessment. This study aims to assess the spatio-temporal EH in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) from 2000 to 2019, based on the Vigor-Organization-Resilience (VOR) model. Vigor, Organization, and Elasticity were assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), landscape matrices, land use and land cover (LULC) data. Local Moran’s I and Coefficient of Variation (CV) was applied to assess EH’s spatial pattern. The results showed that from 2000 to 2019, built-up areas increased by 90%. In contrast, vegetation cover decreased by approximately 57%. EH decreased from 2000 (0.62) to 2019 (0.38). Good EH decreased from 2000 to 2019, 73% to 52%, respectively. Whereas, weak EH increased to 21% in this period. Also, the spatial variability increased from 23% to 56% between 2000 and 2019, respectively. The deterioration of EH in KMA is attributed to the rapid urban expansion and vegetation cover decrease. Therefore, EH needs to be integrated into the decision-making framework for better and sustainable ecosystem management.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"109501","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"GLR2D7YJ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Birhane","lastName":"Emiru"},{"firstName":"Fekensa","lastName":" Zame"},{"firstName":"Tewolde-Berhan","lastName":" Sarah"},{"firstName":"Rannestad","lastName":" Meley Mekonen"},{"firstName":"Solomon","lastName":" Negasi"}],"title":"The diversity and distribution of lianas under various disturbance regimes in Chilimo dry Afromontane forest, Ethiopia","publication_title":"Global Ecology and Conservation","issn":"2351-9894","doi":"10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01045","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989419307760","abstract_note":"Lianas contribute substantially to plant diversity and to local people’s livelihood in tropical forests around the world. However, their species composition and the factors that determine their distribution in dry Afromontane forests are less explored. In this study, we quantified the diversity and density of lianas under various anthropogenic disturbance levels in Chilimo dry Afromontane forest of Ethiopia. We also assessed their importance to the local people. All woody species ≥10 cm and lianas having ≥1 cm diameter size at the point of measurement were recorded in 72, 20 m × 20 m plots distributed on seven transect lines with 2 km distance between transects. We found twenty-four woody vines that belong to 19 genera and 15 families, having an overall density of 1358 liana stems per hectare. These lianas contributed about 25% to the woody plant diversity of the study forest. Six liana-climbing modes were recorded. Stem twiners were predominant in terms of species richness while Scrambler armed climbers were the most abundant species. Liana species richness and abundance were significantly different among the low, moderate, and high forest disturbance levels (p < 0.05) and Liana diversity significantly reduced in highly disturbed forest plots (p < 0.01). Human disturbance indirectly hinders liana assemblage, as liana species richness and abundance showed a positive relationship (p < 0.05) with tree species richness and abundance. The five most abundant species were Carissa spinarum, Rubus steudneri, Rosa abyssinica, Jasminum abyssinicum, and Urera hypselodendron. All the enumerated liana species identified had medicinal, veterinary, food, fence, traditional house construction, fuelwood, grazing, artisan work, and honeybee forage importance to the local residents. Carissa spinarum, Clematis simensis, and Rosa abyssinica were found to be the most important species to the local people having 2, 1.54 and 1.53 importance value index, respectively. There is a need of implementing effective forest management through strengthening the ongoing participatory forest management program to reverse the negative impacts of anthropogenic forest disturbances and to sustain dry Afromontane lianas and their roles in biodiversity and socioeconomic aspects.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"e01045","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Forestdisturbance","Ethnobotany","Relative importance"]},{"key":"26KK4KAQ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Santos","lastName":"Guaciara M."},{"firstName":"Granato-Souza","lastName":" Daniela"},{"firstName":"Barbosa","lastName":" Ana Carolina"},{"firstName":"Oelkers","lastName":" Rose"},{"firstName":"Andreu-Hayles","lastName":" Laia"}],"title":"Radiocarbon analysis confirms annual periodicity in Cedrela odorata tree rings from the equatorial Amazon","publication_title":"Quaternary Geochronology","issn":"1871-1014","doi":"10.1016/j.quageo.2020.101079","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871101420300285","abstract_note":"A Cedrela odorata tree ring width chronology spanning from 1786 to 2016 was developed in the quasi-equatorial eastern Amazon Basin. Annual calendar dates were assigned using dendrochronological techniques at the Federal University of Lavras, Brazil. Due to its strategic location at the edge of the Equator (approximately 0°57′S), an independent confirmation of the annual periodicity of this century-long chronology would be of great value, allowing its future use for climate reconstruction and for filling gaps in upcoming atmospheric radiocarbon (14C) compilations. For reconstruction of atmospheric 14C, high reliability of the dendrochronological calendar dates is a requirement. Here, we used high-precision 14C bomb pulse dating (BPD) of selected C. odorata tree rings as a robust independent method to validate the dendrochronological dates. Eight calendar years from across the pre-to post-bomb period were tested through 14C analysis of α-cellulose extracts (19 targets in total were produced from those 8 calendar years). All dendrochronologically dated tree rings measured produced 14C values in perfect alignment with the Southern Hemisphere 14C bomb curve, further confirming the annual growth of this important record. Extraction of α-cellulose was attained by a recently implemented procedure at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO). The method was 14C assessed by high-precision measurements at the Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (KCCAMS) at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) by measuring reference materials and unknown samples. High reproducibility of reference materials (within uncertainties) showed that the novel 150-funnel system and protocol developed at LDEO is reliable and can potentially expedite cellulose extractions for 14C analysis.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"101079","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Tropicaldendrochronology","Amazon basin","Bomb pulse dating (BPD)","Equatorial line","Inter tropical convergence zone","Radiocarbon (C)"]},{"key":"DF9DP8RM","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Dhewantara","lastName":"Pandji Wibawa"},{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":" Wenyi"},{"firstName":"Al Mamun","lastName":" Abdullah"},{"firstName":"Yin","lastName":" Wen-Wu"},{"firstName":"Ding","lastName":" Fan"},{"firstName":"Guo","lastName":" Danhuai"},{"firstName":"Hu","lastName":" Wenbiao"},{"firstName":"Soares Magalhães","lastName":" Ricardo J."}],"title":"Spatial distribution of leptospirosis incidence in the Upper Yangtze and Pearl River Basin, China: Tools to support intervention and elimination","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138251","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720317642","abstract_note":"Background Since 2011 human leptospirosis incidence in China has remained steadily low with persistent pockets of notifications reported in communities within the Upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB) and Pearl River Basin (PRB). To help guide health authorities within these residual areas to identify communities where interventions should be targeted, this study quantified the local effect of socioeconomic and environmental factors on the spatial distribution of leptospirosis incidence and developed predictive maps of leptospirosis incidence for UYRB and PRB. Methods Data on all human leptospirosis cases reported during 2005–2016 across the UYRB and PRB regions were geolocated at the county-level and included in the analysis. Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) models with zero-inflated Poisson link for leptospirosis incidence were developed after adjustment of environmental and socioeconomic factors such as precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), land surface temperature (LST), elevation, slope, land cover, crop production, livestock density, gross domestic product and population density. Results The relationship of environmental and socioeconomic variables with human leptospirosis incidence varied between both regions. While across UYRB incidence of human leptospirosis was associated with MNDWI and elevation, in PRB human leptospirosis incidence was significantly associated with NDVI, livestock density and land cover. Precipitation was significantly and positively associated with the spatial variation of incidence of leptospirosis in both regions. After accounting for the effect of environmental and socioeconomic factors, the predicted distribution of residual high-incidence county is potentially more widespread both in the UYRB and PRB compared to the observed distribution. In the UYRB, the highest predicted incidence was found along the border of Chongqing and Guizhou towards Sichuan basin and northwest Yunnan. The highest predicted incidence was also identified in counties in the central and lower reaches of the PRB. Conclusions This study demonstrated significant geographical heterogeneity in leptospirosis incidence within UYRB and PRB, providing an evidence base for prioritising targeted interventions in counties identified with the highest predicted incidence. Furthermore, environmental drivers of leptospirosis incidence were highly specific to each of the regions, emphasizing the importance of localized control measures. The findings also suggested the need to expand interventional coverage and to support surveillance and diagnostic capacity on the predicted high-risk areas.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"138251","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Leptospirosis","China","Mapping","Conditional autoregressive","Surveillance"]},{"key":"JMTVPLQF","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Salameh","lastName":"Edward"},{"firstName":"Frappart","lastName":" Frédéric"},{"firstName":"Turki","lastName":" Imen"},{"firstName":"Laignel","lastName":" Benoit"}],"title":"Intertidal topography mapping using the waterline method from Sentinel-1 & -2 images: The examples of Arcachon and Veys Bays in France","publication_title":"ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","issn":"0924-2716","doi":"10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.03.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271620300630","abstract_note":"Intertidal flats lying as a buffer zone between land and sea provide critical services including protection against storm surges and coastal flooding. These environments are characterized by a continuous redistribution of sediment and changes in topography. Sea level rise, anthropogenic pressures, and their related stressors have a considerable impact on these areas and are expected to put them under more stress; hence the increased need for frequent and updated topography maps. Comparing to traditional surveying approaches, spaceborne remote sensing is able to provide topography maps more frequently with a lower cost and a higher coverage. The latter is currently considered as an established tool for measuring intertidal topography. In this study, an improved approach of the waterline method was developed to derive intertidal Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The changes include a faster, more efficient and quasi-automatic detection and post-processing of waterlines. The edge detection technique consists in combining a k-means based segmentation and an active contouring procedure. This method was designed to generate closed contours in order to enable an automatization of the post-processing of the extracted waterlines. The waterlines were extracted from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for two bays located on the French Coast: the Arcachon lagoon and the Bay of Veys. DEMs were generated for the Arcachon Bay between 2015 and 2018, and for the Bay of Veys between 2016 and 2018 using satellite acquisitions made during summer (low storm activity period). The comparison of the generated DEMs with lidar observations showed an error of about 19–25 cm. This study also demonstrated that the waterline method applied to Sentinel images is suitable for monitoring the morpho-sedimentary evolution in intertidal areas. By comparing the DEMs generated between 2016 and 2018, the Arcachon Bay and the Bay of Veys experienced net volume losses of 1.12 × 106 m3 and 0.70 × 106 m3 respectively.

The Caribbean island of Trinidad contains the largest natural asphalt deposit in the world and has a fragmentary record of brief excavations in the early-mid 1900s. We integrated information from collections databases with archival research and field surveys to verify localities, reconstruct taphonomic scenarios, and compile the first comprehensive Pleistocene faunal record for terrestrial Trinidad. To guide interpretations of this poorly sampled region, we conducted a quantitative synthesis of megafaunal mammal abundance data from all known “tar pits” of the western hemisphere, including metrics for sampling coverage and ecological diversity. Based on these metrics, condition of skeletal material, and descriptions of geology, we suggest that the megafaunal remains from Trinidadian localities represent secondary asphaltic preservation, in which hydrocarbons infiltrated in-situ Pleistocene bone beds, thus guiding future excavation approaches. The orders Cingulata, Pilosa, Proboscidea and Rodentia are represented, with genera that are ecologically consistent with the former savanna connection of Trinidad and Venezuela. Using this information, we infer the Quaternary biogeographic and paleoenvironmental history of Trinidad and demonstrate sized-biased extinctions.

However, forests are 3D objects with a vertical structure. The strong penetration of SAR signals means that each pixel contains the contributions of all the scatterers inside the forest canopy, especially for the P-band. Consequently, the traditional texture derived from SAR images is affected by forest vertical heterogeneity, although the influence on texture-based biomass estimation has not yet been explicitly explored. To separate and explore the influence of forest vertical heterogeneity, we introduced the SAR tomography technique into the traditional texture analysis, aiming to explore whether TomoSAR could improve the performance of texture-based aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation and whether texture plus tomographic backscatter could further improve the TomoSAR-based AGB estimation. Based on the P-band TomoSAR dataset from TropiSAR 2009 at two different sites, the results show that ground backscatter variance dominated the texture features of the original SAR image and reduced the biomass estimation accuracy. The texture from upper vegetation layers presented a stronger correlation with forest biomass. Texture successfully improved tomographic backscatter-based biomass estimation, and the texture from upper vegetation layers made AGB models much more transferable between different sites. In addition, the correlation between texture indices varied greatly among different tomographic heights. The texture from the 10 to 30 m layers was able to provide more independent information than the other layers and the original images, which helped to improve the backscatter-based AGB estimation.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"102049","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biomass","Forest","Layered texture","Model transferability","SAR tomography","Texture","Vertical heterogeneity"]},{"key":"H7I8PEXL","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"LeJoncour","lastName":" Anna"},{"firstName":"Blanchard","lastName":" Fabian"},{"firstName":"Tagliarolo","lastName":" Morgana"}],"title":"Spatio-seasonal patterns of demersal fish communities on the French Guiana Coast","publication_title":"Regional Studies in Marine Science","issn":"2352-4855","doi":"10.1016/j.rsma.2020.101105","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235248551930088X","abstract_note":"Estuarine and coastal areas are often considered as hotspots due to their high diversity and ecological importance. However, communities living on those areas are often submitted to fishery and climate change pressures causing modifications on fish assemblages. French Guiana’s coastal shelf is characterised by warm waters with high turbidity and low salinity caused by the large river discharges from the Amazon and nearby estuaries. The high productivity of these areas supports fisheries and aquaculture activities. However, the structure and dynamics of coastal fish populations in French Guiana have seldom been studied. The aim of this study was to understand the effect of environmental conditions, as well as the influence of the coast and nearby estuaries on the spatio-seasonal variability of demersal fish communities living in shallow coastal waters (less than 20m depth). Data were collected from two fishing campaigns using a multi-filament drifting net during the rainy and dry season at 55 sampling stations along the coast. Results showed a high spatial patchiness and no clear seasonal pattern. Higher abundances and diversities were observed near estuaries where both marine and estuarine species were cohabitating. The high number of rare species and the aggregative behaviour recorded in this study suggest that those communities could be particularly affected by climate change, pollution and overfishing. In the light of increasing pressures expected in this area, new regulations and management programs should be developed to ensure food security and biodiversity conservation.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"101105","language":"en","automatic_tags":["FrenchGuiana","Fisheries management","Diversity","Coastal community","Estuary","Tropical waters"]},{"key":"4ZG69SFR","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"LeTourneau","lastName":" François-Michel"}],"title":"Sparsely populated regions as a specific geographical environment","publication_title":"Journal of Rural Studies","issn":"0743-0167","doi":"10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.12.012","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016718315134","abstract_note":"The Amazon forests, the Northern artic regions, the Australian bush and Siberian plains all have very low demographic densities, but they are rarely studied as pertaining to the same global category.

Approaches that integrate airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with mapped extents of forests may improve estimation of mangrove heights by providing considerably more measurements of mangrove tree heights than can be achieved using field-based measurements alone. In this study, we present a validated method for quantifying mangrove AGB that was demonstrated for a mangrove forest at Guarás Island, Brazil. The application of LiDAR to estimate mangrove height was confirmed by correlating 89 tree heights measured in the field with LiDAR-derived mangrove heights, resulting in highly robust relationships for Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle (R2 = 0.90–0.97, RMSE of 1.24–0.67 m and RMSE% of 11.26%–25.97%). These relationships were used to calibrate a LiDAR-derived canopy height model (CHM) and develop robust relationships between the calibrated-CHM and field-based estimates of AGB (R2 = 0.85–0.92, RMSE of 3.1 kg–42.53 kg, RMSE% of 20.66%–43.81%). This relationship was then applied to the CHM whilst accounting for tree density to estimate mangrove AGB. Total mangrove AGB per hectare was estimated to be 246.90 t ha−1, corresponding closely with previous mangrove AGB measurements within the region. This study found that mangrove height and AGB are statistically related and these relationships can be applied to allometric equations for specific species to improve mangrove AGB estimates. This study demonstrates the capacity for LiDAR-derived tree heights to replace traditional approaches to estimating AGB and improving estimates of mangrove blue carbon storage. Application of LiDAR to determine tree heights will be particularly useful where mangrove is extensive and/or remote.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"106585","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mangrove","Blue carbon","Allometry","Above-ground biomass","LiDAR"]},{"key":"I9DTWRLT","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Johns","lastName":"Elizabeth M."},{"firstName":"Lumpkin","lastName":" Rick"},{"firstName":"Putman","lastName":" Nathan F."},{"firstName":"Smith","lastName":" Ryan H."},{"firstName":"Muller-Karger","lastName":" Frank E."},{"firstName":"T.

Historical reports place large quantities of Sargassum only in the North Atlantic (mostly in the Gulf of Mexico and the Sargasso Sea). Accumulations of Sargassum in the tropical Atlantic have continued. We used a numerical particle-tracking system, wind and current reanalysis data, drifting buoy trajectories, and satellite imagery to determine the origin of the Sargassum that is now found persistently in the tropical Atlantic. Our analyses suggest that during the extreme negative phase of the winter 2009–2010 North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), unusually strong and southward-shifted westerly winds explain the transport of Sargassum from the Sargasso Sea (∼20–40°N, 80–20°W) into the far eastern North Atlantic. Our hindcast Sargassum distributions agree with surface current simulations with the inclusion of “windage”. Windage is the additional, wind-induced drift of material floating at the free surface resulting from direct wind forcing on the sea surface, as well as on floating or partially-submerged objects. In our simulations, windage is included as an added vector (speed and direction) to the model-computed surface ocean currents equivalent to 1% of surface wind velocities. Lagrangian analysis of the regional circulation suggests that (1) part of the Sargassum subsequently drifted to the southwest in the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and entered the central tropical Atlantic, arriving in the Caribbean by the spring of 2011, with (2) another portion continuing southward along the coast of Africa in the Canary Current, eventually joining the seasonally-varying system of tropical Atlantic currents and thereby delivering a large Sargassum population to the tropical Atlantic. Since then, Sargassum patches aggregate from March to September in massive windrows along the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) under the action of converging winds. The windrows follow the ITCZ in its seasonal northward migration in the central tropical Atlantic. They are stretched across the central tropical Atlantic as the ITCZ crosses the latitude of the seasonal formation of the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC). These patches and windrows are exposed to high sunlight and open-ocean upward flux of nutrients due to eddy and wind-driven mixing in the central tropical Atlantic. During the northern spring and summer, as the Sargassum drifts farther north with the ITCZ, large portions of the population are advected into the eastern Caribbean Sea. Some of these patches remain dispersed as the ITCZ migrates southward, and re-aggregate into new windrows as the ITCZ intensifies the following March-April. If wind mixing is strong and the mixed layer is deeper than about 50–60 m in the southern tropical Atlantic at this time, the Sargassum will bloom and form a massive windrow. Otherwise, the bloom will be inhibited. The extreme 2009–2010 NAO wind anomaly could be considered as triggering a biosphere “tipping point” that caused important ocean-scale ecosystem changes in the tropical Atlantic, with significant recurrent social and economic consequences. Understanding whether this new expanded geographic range of massive Sargassum blooms is temporary or whether it will revert to its pre-2009 distribution requires sustained monitoring and research.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"102269","language":"en","automatic_tags":["NorthAtlantic Ocean","Caribbean Sea","Ekman pumping","Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)","Mixed layer depth","North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)","Sargasso Sea","Tropical Atlantic","Windage"]},{"key":"NXFLGMWV","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Faber-Langendoen","lastName":"Don"}],"title":"Tropical, Temperate, and Mediterranean Grasslands of the World","publication_title":"Encyclopedia of the World's Biomes","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095489120937","abstract_note":"Grasslands of the world span the tropics to temperate regions.

Emphasis is placed on the Holocene, when the full occupation of the planet by modern humans took place and increased the complexity of organism-environment interactions by adding not only a new dimension (i.e., the human one) but also the ensuing feedbacks and synergies with others (i.e., environment and ecosystems). The Neolithic Revolution is highlighted as the onset of global anthropogenic influence leading to profound changes in the configuration and dynamics of the biosphere occurred during the last 5000 years. Human influence on the biosphere has increased during the last centuries, since the Industrial Revolution, after which humans have been considered as an ecological, evolutionary and biogeographical driver comparable to other natural telluric forces.

AMPERA is an electric field mill network which locally measures the electrostatic field at the aircraft fuselage. The distribution and amplitude of the electrostatic field on the aircraft skin depends on the atmospheric electrostatic field around the aircraft and the net electric charge of the aircraft. This latter parameter depends on the balance between the triboelectric current due to the impact of the cloud particles on the aircraft fuselage, the current due to the charged particles emitted by the engines, and the corona current emitted by the aircraft.

In this paper we address the problem of PV penetration in electricity networks, by considering both (1) the spatial issue of site selection and size, and (2) the temporal aspect of hourly load and demand satisfaction, in addition with the investment and maintenance costs to guarantee a viable and reliable solution. We propose to address this spatio-temporal optimization problem through an integrated GIS and robust optimization model, that allows handling of the ubiquitous dependencies between resource and demand time variability and the selection of optimal sites of renewable power generation. Our approach contributes to the integration of the multi-dimensional and combinatorial aspects of this problem, gathering geographical layers (regional or national scale) and temporal packing (hourly time stamp) constraints, and cost functions. This model computes the optimal geographical location and size of PV facilities allowing energy planning targets to be met at minimal cost in a reliable manner. In this paper, we illustrate our approach by studying the penetration of large-scale solar PV in the French Guiana’s power system. Among the results, we show for instance that: (1) our approach performs geographical aggregation with real contextual data, i.e. balances the intermittency of RE sources by spreading out the corresponding installations (location + size) across the territory; (2) the total installed PV capacity can be doubled by removing the 35% penetration limit on intermittent power without exceeding hourly demand; (3) the safest investment scenario is below 30MW of new PV facilities (≈45M€ and 2 plants), though it is theoretically possible to install up to 45MW (>120M€ and 11 plants).","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"114257","language":"en","automatic_tags":["GIS","Energy planning","Solar PV","Robust optimization","Site selection","Spatiotemporal dimensions"]},{"key":"MKEIDDQX","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Luiso","lastName":"Joseph"},{"firstName":"Kellner","lastName":" Katrin"},{"firstName":"Matthews","lastName":" Alix E."},{"firstName":"Mueller","lastName":" Ulrich G."},{"firstName":"Seal","lastName":" Jon N."}],"title":"High diversity and multiple invasions to North America by fungi grown by the northern-most Trachymyrmex and Mycetomoellerius ant species","publication_title":"Fungal Ecology","issn":"1754-5048","doi":"10.1016/j.funeco.2019.100878","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1754504819301527","abstract_note":"Lower diversity at range margins of expanding populations is thought to reduce host-symbiont specificity of obligate symbioses.

This paper presents the first spatially-continuous view of terrestrial leaf chlorophyll content (ChlLeaf) at the global scale. Weekly maps of ChlLeaf were produced from ENVISAT MERIS full resolution (300 m) satellite data using a two-stage physically-based radiative transfer modelling approach. Firstly, leaf-level reflectance was derived from top-of-canopy satellite reflectance observations using 4-Scale and SAIL canopy radiative transfer models for woody and non-woody vegetation, respectively. Secondly, the modelled leaf-level reflectance was input into the PROSPECT leaf-level radiative transfer model to derive ChlLeaf. The ChlLeaf retrieval algorithm was validated using measured ChlLeaf data from 248 sample measurements at 28 field locations, and covering six plant functional types (PFTs). Modelled results show strong relationships with field measurements, particularly for deciduous broadleaf forests (R2 = 0.67; RMSE = 9.25 μg cm-2; p < 0.001), croplands (R2 = 0.41; RMSE = 13.18 μg cm-2; p < 0.001) and evergreen needleleaf forests (R2 = 0.47; RMSE = 10.63 μg cm-2; p < 0.001). When the modelled results from all PFTs were considered together, the overall relationship with measured ChlLeaf remained good (R2 = 0.47, RMSE = 10.79 μg cm-2; p < 0.001). This result is an improvement on the relationship between measured ChlLeaf and a commonly used chlorophyll-sensitive spectral vegetation index; the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI; R2 = 0.27, p < 0.001). The global maps show large temporal and spatial variability in ChlLeaf, with evergreen broadleaf forests presenting the highest leaf chlorophyll values, with global annual median values of 54.4 μg cm-2.

Processes that best account for the features observed in these strata are glaciation, deglaciation and sedimentary deformation. Four main glacial ages are identified to have occurred in the Parnaíba Basin during the Paleozoic. Glacially influenced deposits are found in the Lower Silurian, Upper Devonian, Lower Mississippian, and Middle Mississippian strata. The Parnaíba Basin is characterized by outcrops providing robust lithological evidence for three glacial ages, identified by lithological features and dated by palynological studies. A fourth glaciation, as old as Tournaisian, was recently recognized only in the subsurface of the basin. The glacial features were illustrated and the rocks accurately dated with palynomorphs based on very accurate palynological studies. Additional, palynological information, derives from outcrops and shallow boreholes drilled by a private company (Themag) and the National State Mineral Production Department (Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral -DNPM), and the Brazilian Geological Survey Company (Companhia de Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais-CPRM). The purpose of this reexamination, including many new illustrations, interpretations and conclusions, is to evaluate primary sedimentological and paleontological data related to the above mentioned glaciations. Some authors remain skeptical about the record of Early to early Late Paleozoic glaciations in western Gondwana, especially in Brazil, mainly because evidence provided in the literature is relatively scanty. The Parnaíba Basin provides special conditions for the study of these glaciations, although evidence for each of them varies considerably as discussed in the text.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"103002","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Correlation","Northeast Brazil","Paleozoic glaciations/deglaciations","Parnaíba Basin"]},{"key":"8BYYK3UV","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Shibao"},{"firstName":"Dai","lastName":" Weidong"},{"firstName":"Tang","lastName":" Yao"},{"firstName":"Guo","lastName":" Min"}],"title":"A review of the impact of hydropower reservoirs on global climate change","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134996","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719349885","abstract_note":"Three types of greenhouse gases (GHGs), namely carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emitted from reservoirs have an important but often ignored impact on the climate change.

In Bolivia, the reporting of small outbreaks occurred until 2012. The findings of 40 laboratory-confirmed cases diagnosed in two departments are reported herein. Methods This was an observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study. Data on laboratory-confirmed cases in 2018 were collected from the hospitals and departmental health services (SEDES) of Santa Cruz and Tarija. An ELISA was used for the detection of IgM antibody to hantavirus in the patient blood samples. Results Forty patients were IgM-positive. The median age of the patients was 24 years (interquartile range 19–41 years) and 72.5% were male. All patients were hospitalized; 57.5% were admitted to the intensive care unit and had cardiopulmonary compromise, with 83% of these presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome and 89.5% of these requiring mechanical ventilation. Six patients died (CFR 15%). Patients <15 or >60 years old were more prone to die (odds ratio 10.33, 95% confidence interval 1.411–75.694), as were those with comorbidities (odds ratio 16.5, 95% confidence interval 1.207–225.540).

These viruses share structural, antigenic, and genomic features, but each has a unique epidemiological and ecological repertoire. The mammarenaviruses includes mostly rodent-borne viruses that have not been associated with human or animal disease. A total of 11 of the mammarenaviruses have been linked to human disease, varying from subclinical and mild infections to fatal hemorrhagic fevers. The reptarenaviruses have been isolated from boas and pythons suffering from inclusion body disease. The complex evolutionary history of these viruses remains to be fully understood, but with the continued discovery of novel arenaviruses and at the hand of technologies such as deep sequencing, the pieces of the puzzle can be put together. The segmented genomes and remarkable genomic sequence diversity of these viruses also allows for the study of the potential drivers of the emergence of novel viruses through recombination and segment switching which also elude to the interaction of the hosts of these viruses.

In many cases the vectors and hosts have adapted to the changes and have risen to higher latitudes and altitudes, which could contribute to the appearance of outbreaks or new outbreaks of new arboviruses of public health importance. Different cohabiting species can be reservoirs or vectors of arboviruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Currently, some viruses transmitted by mosquito vectors, such as dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus, have caused epidemic outbreaks with important effects on human populations. It is possible that the expansion of vectors and their diseases reaches developed countries such as the United States and the European Union with a great impact on public health. The clinical signs of the diseases produced by arboviruses can vary from nonspecific febrile syndrome, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and even death.

The genus Flavivirus includes other arthropod borne viruses such as yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. It infects ~50–200 million people annually, putting over 3.6 billion people living in tropical regions at risk and causing ~20,000 deaths annually. The expansion of dengue is attributed to factors such as the modern dynamics of climate change, globalization, travel, trade, socioeconomics, settlement, and also viral evolution. There are four antigenically different serotypes of DENV based on the differences in their viral structural and nonstructural proteins. DENV infection causes a spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic to dengue fever to severe dengue shock syndrome. Infection with one serotype confers lifelong immunity against that serotype, but heterologus infection leads to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever due to antibody-dependent enhancement. Diagnosis of dengue infections is based mainly on serological detection of either antigen in acute cases or antibodies in both acute and chronic infection. Viral detection and real-time PCR detection though helpful is not feasible in resource poor setup. Treatment of dengue depends on symptomatic management along with fluid resuscitation and may require platelet transfusion. Although vaccine development is in late stages of development, developing a single vaccine against four serotypes often causes serious challenges to researchers; hence, the main stay of prevention is vector control and management.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"281-359","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Dengue","antiviral","dengue hemorrhagic fever","dengue shock syndrome","epidemiology","vaccine","vector control"]},{"key":"R74LATUI","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Monteiro","lastName":"Wuelton Marcelo"},{"firstName":"Gomes","lastName":" Jacimara"},{"firstName":"Fé","lastName":" Nelson"},{"firstName":"Mendonça da Silva","lastName":" Iran"},{"firstName":"Lacerda","lastName":" Marcus"},{"firstName":"Alencar","lastName":" Aristóteles"},{"firstName":"Seabra de Farias","lastName":" Altair"},{"firstName":"Val","lastName":" Fernando"},{"firstName":"de Souza Sampaio","lastName":" Vanderson"},{"firstName":"Cardoso de Melo","lastName":" Gisely"},{"firstName":"Pardal","lastName":" Pedro"},{"firstName":"Mota da Silva","lastName":" Ageane"},{"firstName":"Bernarde","lastName":" Paulo Sergio"},{"firstName":"Carlos de Lima Ferreira","lastName":" Luiz"},{"firstName":"Gutierrez","lastName":" José María"},{"firstName":"de Almeida Gonçalves Sachett","lastName":" Jacqueline"},{"firstName":"Fan","lastName":" Hui Wen"}],"title":"Perspectives and recommendations towards evidence-based health care for scorpion sting envenoming in the Brazilian Amazon: A comprehensive review","publication_title":"Toxicon","issn":"0041-0101","doi":"10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.09.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041010119304453","abstract_note":"Although underreported across the Amazon region, scorpion stings are very prevalent in some areas and can be potentially life-threatening, especially in children.

Parallel trends of Hg and XRF-Fe plots suggest that following atmospheric Hg deposition onto the continent, Hg is incorporated with Fe compounds before transportation and eventual immobilization at the NE Brazil continental slope. Peaks of Hg and Fe/Ca ratio peaks occurred concurrently during certain Heinrich Stadials, indicating that Hg is transported from the continent alongside fluvial sediments during periods of increased precipitation and erosion in NE Brazil continent. Mercury concentrations varied with periodicities of 56 ka and 900 yr suggesting glacial-interglacial changes and millennial-scale variability, respectively. Total Hg and total organic carbon are poorly correlated, although the latter likely influenced Hg sequestration into marine sediments during millennial-scale events between 60 ka and 30 ka. Altogether, our results suggest that the atmosphere is the primary source of Hg to GL-1248 and glacial-interglacial climate variations were the major determinant of atmospheric Hg deposition.

First, we construct a taxonomy of six inter-related forms of invisibility (social marginalization, forced invisibility by migrants, spatial marginalization, neglected diseases, mental health, uneven climatic monitoring and forecasting) which underlie systematic biases in current understanding of these risks in Latin America, and advocate an approach to climate-health research that draws on intersectionality theory to address these inter-relations. We propose that these invisibilities should be understood as outcomes of structural imbalances in power and resources rather than as haphazard blindspots in scientific and state knowledge. Our thesis, drawing on theories of governmentality, is that context-dependent tensions condition whether or not benefits of making vulnerable populations legible to the state outweigh costs. To be seen is to be politically counted and eligible for rights, yet evidence demonstrates the perils of visibility to disempowered people. For example, flood-relief efforts in remote Amazonia expose marginalized urban river-dwellers to the traumatic prospect of forced relocation and social and economic upheaval. Finally, drawing on research on citizenship in post-colonial settings, we conceptualize climate change as an ‘open moment’ of political rupture, and propose strategies of social accountability, empowerment and trans-disciplinary research which encourage the marginalized to reach out for greater power. These achievements could reduce drawbacks of state legibility and facilitate socially-just governmental action on climate change adaptation that promotes health for all.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"112448","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Governmentality","Bias","Climatic extremes","Healthcare","Inequity","Justice","Marginalization","Rights"]},{"key":"9QT43DTP","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Nordhaus","lastName":"Inga"},{"firstName":"Toben","lastName":" Marijana"},{"firstName":"Fauziyah","lastName":" Arida"}],"title":"Impact of deforestation on mangrove tree diversity, biomass and community dynamics in the Segara Anakan lagoon, Java, Indonesia: A ten-year perspective","publication_title":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","issn":"0272-7714","doi":"10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106300","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771418303597","abstract_note":"Indonesia has the largest area and the highest tree species richness but also one of the highest loss rates of mangroves worldwide. The Segara Anakan lagoon is a mangrove-fringed estuarine system in Java which is highly affected by deforestation, sedimentation, and land-use changes. The spatial variability of diversity, community composition, density, height, aboveground biomass and habitat complexity of the mangrove forest in relation to abiotic conditions was studied in 2014/2015. Vegetation characteristics were compared with those available from 2005/2006, and the effects of deforestation on the forest condition were assessed. In total, 15 mangrove tree species were recorded in 2015, six less than ten years ago. The two main areas of the lagoon, the central and eastern one, had a significantly different tree community composition. The central area was dominated by the palm Nypa fruticans and Aegiceras corniculatum and 74% of the ground was covered by the understorey plants Acanthus spp. and Derris trifoliata. Tree density, stand basal area, species number, aboveground biomass, and habitat complexity were significantly lower in the central area as a result of deforestation. Stand basal area and aboveground biomass decreased significantly over the 10 years as well as the density of Avicennia spp., Sonneratia spp., Ceriops spp., Aegiceras corniculatum, and Bruguiera spp. The eastern area was dominated by A. corniculatum and Rhizophora apiculata, and coverage with understorey plants was only 11%. The density of R. apiculata increased significantly over the 10 years as a result of natural regeneration and reforestation. The overall low tree height (2.8 m) and aboveground biomass (18.4 t dry mass ha−1) point to a young and degraded forest. In the central lagoon, mangrove reforestation is probably extremely difficult due to the strong expansion of understorey plants. It is assumed that ongoing deforestation will cause a further spread of understorey plants, a decrease in species number, tree density and habitat complexity. A decline in microhabitats and aboveground biomass can lead to a decrease of faunal species and biomass which in turn would influence nutrient cycling and impair the nursery function of the area. Also, important ecosystem services, particularly coastal protection against storms and prevention of coastal erosion are most likely affected.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"106300","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Abovegroundbiomass","Deforestation","Reforestation","Habitat complexity","Mangrove vegetation","Temporal changes"]},{"key":"R489RF79","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Jiangong"},{"firstName":"Lai","lastName":" Derrick Y.

Yet, there is hitherto a paucity of researches examining the temporal variations and environmental controls of ecosystem-scale CO2 fluxes in subtropical mangroves using quasi-continuous, high temporal resolution measurements. In this study, we measured the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) between the atmosphere and a subtropical estuarine mangrove dominated by Kandelia obovata using an eddy covariance system for two full years to investigate the seasonal variability and key biophysical drivers of NEE. During the wet seasons, the magnitude of increase in ecosystem respiration (Re) was greater than that in gross primary productivity (GPP) owing to a combination of higher temperature and lower percentage of inundation, tidal height and water salinity, which subsequently resulted in an overall decrease in net CO2 uptake as compared to the dry seasons. Our results of path analysis showed that temperature was a dominant control of the temporal variations in CO2 flux during the wet seasons, while its influence became weaker during the dry seasons. On the other hand, an increase in water salinity during the dry seasons had a positive influence on GPP, which was likely related to a greater availability of ions (mainly Cl− and Na+) in supporting photosynthesis by mangrove trees in this coastal wetland with relatively low salinity (∼5–15 ppt). Our subtropical mangrove wetland was shown to be a significant carbon (C) sink, with annual C uptake rates of 890 and 758 g CO2-C m-2 yr−1 in the two years of study. We found a strong control of mangrove CO2 fluxes by biophysical factors such as temperature and salinity, implying that global warming and a reduction in water salinity in response to a greater river discharge could potentially reduce the C sink strength of estuarine mangroves in the subtropical regions.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"107644","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mangrove","Carbon dioxide","Blue carbon","Eddy covariance","Coastal wetland","Net ecosystem exchange"]},{"key":"SV5R93J8","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Meerdink","lastName":"Susan K."},{"firstName":"Roberts","lastName":" Dar A."},{"firstName":"Roth","lastName":" Keely L."},{"firstName":"King","lastName":" Jennifer Y."},{"firstName":"Gader","lastName":" Paul D."},{"firstName":"Koltunov","lastName":" Alexander"}],"title":"Classifying California plant species temporally using airborne hyperspectral imagery","publication_title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","issn":"0034-4257","doi":"10.1016/j.rse.2019.111308","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442571930327X","abstract_note":"Accurate knowledge of seasonal and inter-annual distributions of plant species is required for many research and management agendas that track ecosystem health. Airborne imaging spectroscopy data have been used successfully to map plant species, but often only in a single season or over a limited spatial extent due to data availability. NASA's Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) preparatory airborne campaign flew an imaging spectrometer from 2013 to 2015. This dataset captured a severe drought and thus provided the opportunity to evaluate species discrimination over an extreme range in environmental conditions. Here we evaluate the portability of image-based training data and accuracy of species discrimination. The imagery was acquired in the spring, summer, and fall seasons of 2013–2015 with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Reference spectral libraries were developed with three sets of spectra: spectra from a single image date, combining spectra from multiple dates (by season, by year, and from all dates), and creating leave-one-out (LOO) libraries that pooled spectra from all dates but one. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was applied to reduce data dimensionality, and classification was performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). When only spectra from the same image date were used, plant species were classified with a mean kappa accuracy ranging between 0.80 and 0.86 for the nine dates. Seasonal and annual spectral libraries had comparable accuracies with mean kappa 0.79–0.83 and 0.78–0.83, respectively. Seasonal libraries performed slightly better than annual libraries for species because they better-incorporated changes in spectra due to phenology. Spectral libraries were not transferable across dates, with mean kappa accuracies dropping to 0.31–0.73 for LOO spectral libraries. These results emphasize that spectral libraries built from previously collected imagery may not be able to map plant species over new images accurately. Specifically, our results highlight the need to use reference spectra that adequately represent the phenological and biophysical status of the plant species within an image for accurate mapping. Our research provides relevant insight for advanced species-mapping techniques across broad spatial and temporal scales using imagery from sensors like HyspIRI.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"111308","language":"en","automatic_tags":["AVIRIS","Discriminant analysis","Hyperspectral","HyspIRI","Imaging spectroscopy","Plant species classification","Time series","Vegetation phenology"]},{"key":"AYIJPX7F","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Viviescas","lastName":"Cindy"},{"firstName":"Lima","lastName":" Lucas"},{"firstName":"Diuana","lastName":" Fabio A."},{"firstName":"Vasquez","lastName":" Eveline"},{"firstName":"Ludovique","lastName":" Camila"},{"firstName":"Silva","lastName":" Gabriela N."},{"firstName":"Huback","lastName":" Vanessa"},{"firstName":"Magalar","lastName":" Leticia"},{"firstName":"Szklo","lastName":" Alexandre"},{"firstName":"Lucena","lastName":" André F.

The second determines possible impacts on the future long-term wind and solar resource complementarities due to climate change for those regions where complementarity was previously identified. For this, results of two General Circulation Models (GCMs) for two Representative Concentration Pathways - RCPs (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) are used. Results show a higher variability for wind power when compared to solar power generation resources both on an hourly and monthly scales. Results also indicate that Brazil can play an important role regarding renewable energy integration in LA, since the country has the strongest capacity to complement and to be complemented by other LA countries.

Net primary productivity and carbon sequestration potential play a pivotal role in understanding the characteristics of the forest ecosystem. Therefore, in order to assess whether the age of mangrove forest and species composition has any influence on the net primary productivity and carbon sequestration potential; six plots of different age group (2, 7, 8, 12, 13 yrs and natural population), and mangrove species combinations were studied in Pichavaram mangrove forest, Tamil Nadu, India. Soil temperature, net canopy photosynthesis and forest functional index significantly varied between mangrove species and age. Regression analysis showed that the soil pH and bulk density positively influenced the carbon sequestration potential which was significant between age group. Higher age group (13yrs) and the natural site showed two-fold higher (21.52 ± 0.72 gC/m2/day) net canopy photosynthesis. Forest functional index, shoot Biomass, root Biomass, plant biomass, carbon biomass and CO2 equivalent showed significant variation with species or age having maximum value in natural plot. Net primary productivity was significant between mangrove species or age. However, carbon sequestration potential increased with the increase in age of plants. Maximum carbon sequestration potential was found in Xylocarpus mekongensis. The data obtained from the present study can be effectively used for drafting conservation and management policies for the fragile mangrove forest ecosystem.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"101235","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Carbonsequestration","Mangroves","Age","Primary productivity","Sediment analysis","Vegetative characteristics"]},{"key":"B72NGVZS","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Gross","lastName":"Michael"}],"title":"Hunting wildlife to extinction","publication_title":"Current Biology","issn":"0960-9822","doi":"10.1016/j.cub.2019.05.063","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219306773","abstract_note":"The UN biodiversity report released in May has highlighted the critical situation of biodiversity and the resulting threats to ecosystem services and thus to human survival.

Surface conductance (gs) is a poorly understood phenomenon that plays a central role in regulating this evapotranspiration. We studied the calculations, variations, and environmental factors controlling gs based on eddy flux measurements from 10 tropical forest sites that covered a wide range of water gradients across continents. We found that boundary layer conductance (gb) is comparable with aerodynamic conductance for momentum (gaM) and thus, it should not be ignored in estimations of total aerodynamic conductance for water vapor (gaV). Based on the findings, we have made some recommendations for gaM estimation both with and without measurements of turbulence. The seasonal variation of gs is low in humid sites but large in sites with a dry season. A value of 24.8 ± 13.8 mm s−1 was suggested for maximum surface conductance (gsmax) for tropical forests. Both water vapor deficit (D) and radiation (Q) play an important role in controlling gs. The model driven by both D and Q could capture the diurnal variations of gs well and could be implemented in large-scale models in future. We believe the findings of this study could contribute substantially to our understanding of tropical forest gs.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"317-328","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Boundarylayer conductance","Energy imbalance correction","Jarvis stomata model","Maximum surface conductance","Penman–Monteith equation"]},{"key":"ILKUSKIN","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Le"},{"firstName":"Jia","lastName":" Mingming"},{"firstName":"Yin","lastName":" Dameng"},{"firstName":"Tian","lastName":" Jinyan"}],"title":"A review of remote sensing for mangrove forests: 1956–2018","publication_title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","issn":"0034-4257","doi":"10.1016/j.rse.2019.111223","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425719302421","abstract_note":"Mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems that typically dominate the intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical coastlines. The history of mangrove remote sensing (RS) can be traced back to 1956. Over the last six decades, hot spot topics in the field of mangrove RS have evolved from mangrove distribution mapping, biophysical parameters inversion, to ecosystem process characterization. Although several review articles have been published to summarize the progress in this field, none of them highlighted the key milestones of historical developments pertinent to major research topics or key drivers that stimulate such milestones. In this review, we aim to identify key milestones in mangrove RS by associating the emergence of major research topics with the occurrence of new sensors in four historical phases, i.e. before 1989, 1990–1999, 2000–2009, and 2010-2018. For each identified research topic, an in-depth theoretical understanding was achieved by analyses of both the first published article and the most-cited article. Based on the analyses, the current state of knowledge as well as existing limitations were summarized. In addition, in order to gain insights on driving forces for emergence of new research topics, we compared the chronological evolution of mangrove RS with that of terrestrial forest RS. Interestingly, we found that key research topics in mangrove RS replicated those of forest RS yet with varying time lags. This can be attributed to the following two facts: 1) mangrove forests often appear as more elongated patches than terrestrial forests; 2) field work is more challenging in mangrove habitat. Along with the RS sensors' advancement, various topics that had been studied in terrestrial forests were later transformed to mangrove studies. Based on the projected growth of foreseeing earth observation capacity, insights on future research directions in mangrove RS were also presented.","date_added":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","date_modified":"2022-06-01 11:59:00","pages":"111223","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mangrove","Review","Remote sensing","Driving factors","Milestones","Research topics"]},{"key":"SB826KQ2","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Pei"},{"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":" Huan"},{"firstName":"Duan","lastName":" Dandan"},{"firstName":"Pan","lastName":" Ke"}],"title":"A review on mercury biogeochemistry in mangrove sediments: Hotspots of methylmercury production?","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.451","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719320091","abstract_note":"Wetlands are highly productive and biologically diverse environments that provide numerous ecosystem services, but can also be sources of methylmercury (MeHg) production and export. Mangrove wetlands contribute up to 15% of the coastal sediment carbon storage and ~10% of the particulate terrestrial carbon exported to the ocean. Thus, mercury (Hg) methylation in mangrove sediments and subsequent MeHg output to adjacent waters could have a great impact on global Hg cycling. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the literature on worldwide Hg concentrations in mangrove ecosystems, and the results reveal that a large range of total Hg (THg) and MeHg concentrations is detected in mangrove systems. Then, we discuss the potential roles of organic matter (OM) in controlling the Hg biogeochemistry in mangrove sediments. The intense OM decomposition by anoxic reduction (e.g., sulfate reduction) drastically affects sediment chemistries, such as redox potential, pH, and sulfur speciation, all of which may have a great impact on MeHg production. While the outwelling of carbon from mangroves has been extensively examined, little is known about their roles in exporting MeHg to adjacent waters. Our understanding of Hg biogeochemical processes in mangrove systems is constrained by the limited MeHg data and a lack of in-depth studies on the Hg methylation potential in this ecologically important environment. More efforts are needed to gain better insights into the contributions mangrove wetlands to the global Hg cycle.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"140-150","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mangrove","Sediments","Methylmercury","Mercury","Bioavailability"]},{"key":"CEF2KADN","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Sahar"},{"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":" Mohamed Abd El-Fatah"},{"firstName":"Viarouge","lastName":" Cyril"},{"firstName":"Sailleau","lastName":" Corinne"},{"firstName":"Zientara","lastName":" Stephan"},{"firstName":"Breard","lastName":" Emmanuel"}],"title":"Presence of bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses in Egypt in 2016 and 2017","publication_title":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","issn":"1567-1348","doi":"10.1016/j.meegid.2019.04.033","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134819300772","abstract_note":"BTV and EHDV are closely-related orbiviruses that are transmitted between domestic and wild ruminants via the bites of hematophagous midges.

A total of 227 cattle blood samples were therefore collected in 2016 and 2017. Ninety-four of the 227 animals tested by a BTV ELISA were positive for BTV antibodies (41.4%). Of these 94 ELISA-positive cattle, only 83 EDTA-blood samples were available and therefore tested for BTV and EHDV genome detection by RT-PCR and sequencing. Of the cattle sampled in 2016, results revealed that two were RT-PCR-positive for BTV and seven for EHDV. Sequencing showed the presence of EHDV-1 and BTV-3 genome sequences. EHDV-1 S2 shared 99.5% homology with an EHDV-1 S2 from a strain isolated in 2016 in Israel.

The tendency of mining activity to overspill institutional boundaries is contributing to worsening ecological conditions in the country’s interior. For miners, it is shown that, even having acquired or accessed formal property, they face various challenges (such as minimal state support, stressed conditions of production, and tenure insecurity) that compromise their ability to enact ‘green’ mining. The state meanwhile faces related challenges in ensuring that dynamic and fluid mining activity remains within its legal and literal boundaries.

We used a dynamic chamber method to monitor RCWD over time in two reciprocal translocation field experiments by placing CWD of the same decay stage from three tree species into two different forest types. The three species used were Cryptomeria japonica (CR), Platycarya strobilacea (PL) and Acer davidii (AC); the two forest types were broadleaf forest (home field for PL and AC; visiting field for CR) and coniferous forest (home field for CR; visiting field for PL and AC). We also characterized the microbial community of each CWD and the soil underneath as well as the control soil without CWD influence by the method of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). We found that the RCWD of PL and AC in the HF were significantly higher than that in the VF, while the opposite was true for the RCWD of CR. Soil microbial community affected CWD microbial community, especially for the bacteria component, with field site explaining 17.4% of the total variation in CWD microbial community. Our results suggest that the difference in CWD decomposition between home and visiting field was directly explained by the difference in soil microbial community between home and visiting field, which may be attributed to the differences in soil nutrient and litter quality between the two field sites (forest types).","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"127-137","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Home-fieldadvantage","Coarse woody debris","Respiration","Soil microbial community","Subtropical forests"]},{"key":"6QCBNCTH","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Kılıç","lastName":"Merve"},{"firstName":"Uyar","lastName":" Ali"},{"firstName":"Karaman","lastName":" Abdullah S."}],"title":"What impacts sustainability reporting in the global aviation industry?

The Geheyan Reservoir was selected as a typical canyon case to carry out continuous measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes from March 2015 to February 2016. Carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from the interface between the water and atmosphere were identified at the following sites: above the dam, upstream, in a tributary, in the drawdown area, and in a bay within the reservoir. Results indicated that average CO2 fluxes in Geheyan Reservoir were 55.69+66.33mgm−2h−1. Carbon dioxide emissions were lower in spring and summer when the water level frequently varied for flood control. In addition, CO2 fluxes were higher when water flowed slowly with relatively high water levels that remained stable continuously. On a spatial scale, CO2 emissions were lower in the drawdown area of the tributary and below the dam, while higher CO2 emissions occurred in the typical bay area where water velocity was very slow. Therefore, it can be concluded that a longer residence time and slower water velocity caused generally higher CO2 emissions from Geheyan Reservoir. The seasonal change of CO2 fluxes in the Yuxiakou backwater-area monitoring point was very stable no matter how the water level changed, but was higher than below the dam and in the drawdown area in most months. Temporal and spatial patterns of CO2 fluxes were significantly controlled by water temperature among all environmental variables for Geheyan Reservoir.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"499-514","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Carboncycle","Reservoir","Spatial and temporal variation","Carbon dioxide fluxes"]},{"key":"9CMSLXZH","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Tallobre","lastName":"Cédric"},{"firstName":"Giresse","lastName":" Pierre"},{"firstName":"Bassetti","lastName":" Maria-Angela"},{"firstName":"Loncke","lastName":" Lies"},{"firstName":"Bayon","lastName":" Germain"},{"firstName":"Buscail","lastName":" Roselyne"},{"firstName":"Tudryn","lastName":" Alina"},{"firstName":"Zaragosi","lastName":" Sébastien"}],"title":"Formation and evolution of glauconite in the Demerara Contourite depositional system related to NADW circulation changes during late Quaternary (French Guiana)","publication_title":"Journal of South American Earth Sciences","issn":"0895-9811","doi":"10.1016/j.jsames.2019.03.011","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981118302827","abstract_note":"The Demerara Plateau is a marginal plateau which forms a bathymetric relief on the sea floor.

N2O production has been more carefully studied in soils, but runoff of reactive nitrogen, likely from fertilizer, influences lotic N2O emissions. N2O production and consumption are strongly microbially mediated and mostly involve oxidation and reduction of the reactive nitrogen species ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite. Of the four main pathways leading to N2O production in soils and sediments, incomplete denitrification is likely the globally dominant N2O generating pathway and is favored by elevated nitrate concentrations, suboxic conditions, and sufficient organic carbon to promote reduction. The two pathways that oxidize ammonia, nitrifier denitrification and nitrification, are favored with higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen and ammonia. It is often difficult to distinguish these two pathways in field settings, but most evidence suggests that nitrifier-denitrification is likely the globally more significant of the two. The fourth reaction pathway is dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA), in which N2O may be produced from intermediate nitrite. This pathway is more recently discovered, and its global relevance remains uncertain. The key variables influencing N2O cycling, concentrations of the primary reactants (nitrate and ammonia), organic carbon, and dissolved oxygen (DO), may vary temporally with season and time of day. Increasing nitrate and ammonia generally result in higher N2O production. Elevated carbon availability generally promotes denitrification. However, N2O yield is generally higher when carbon is less available or less reactive. Efforts to quantify N2O in lotic settings include mostly studies of N2O dissolved in or emitted from surface water, with fewer studies of N2O produced or emitted from sediments. With some exceptions and limits, N2O emissions are generally positively correlated with nitrate concentration (and in some cases, ammonia concentration). Most studies observe more N2O emissions with low DO. Lotic N2O emissions were generally higher in the warmer months and at night. Most studies assume a denitrification source for N2O, except in the case of high DO and NH4+, in which nitrification is assumed. Lotic N2O production and consumption may take place in the hyporheic zone along groundwater flow paths and in the water column of streams and rivers. Because microbial nitrogen processing requires substrate, influx of reactants, appropriate redox conditions, and intermediate residence times, the hyporheic zone is likely the site of most N2O production. However, high rates of N2O production may also occur associated with suspended sediments in turbid streams and rivers. Models that combine hydromorphogical and chemical variables are most likely to provide the best predictions of N2O emissions. Such models and some observations suggest that N2O emissions decrease downstream as sedimentary processes (likely denitrification) decrease relative to processes in the surface water (likely nitrification). Downstream sites could have large N2O emissions, however, due to inputs of nitrate or ammonia. Better quantification of lotic N2O processing will inform the emission factors incorporated into greenhouse gas budgets. Both quantification and mitigation of N2O emissions will benefit from future research that more closely examines the biogeochemical pathways and physical settings for N2O production and consumption.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"224-262","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"XEKAHZ7Z","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Mure-Ravaud","lastName":"Mathieu"},{"firstName":"Dib","lastName":" Alain"},{"firstName":"Kavvas","lastName":" M.

This method is physically based as it uses a regional atmospheric model to reconstruct the precipitation depth field from a tropical cyclone, thus crucially conserving the mass, momentum and energy in the system. In this physically based storm transposition method, the tropical cyclone vortex in the simulation initial conditions is first shifted spatially. More precisely, the tropical cyclone at the simulation start date is first separated from its background environment, then shifted, and finally recombined with the background environment. Afterwards, the regional atmospheric model is run as usual to simulate the shifted tropical cyclone and its precipitation depth field. The storm transposition method was then applied to four hurricanes which spawned torrential precipitation in the United States: Hurricanes Floyd (1999), Frances (2004), Ivan (2004), and Isaac (2012), in order to maximize the 72-h precipitation depth over the drainage basin of the city of Asheville, NC. It was observed that the precipitation depth fields changed in both structure and intensity after the physically based storm transposition. Besides, the tropical cyclone tracks were generally very sensitive to changes in the initial conditions, which is expected for a storm system whose dynamics is strongly nonlinear. In particular, it was found that a small change in the location of the initial tropical cyclone vortex may result in a very different track, allowing the tropical cyclone's precipitation depth field to move over the target area.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"252-273","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Dynamicaldownscaling","Intense precipitation","Storm transposition","Physically based","Probable Maximum Precipitation","Tropical cyclone"]},{"key":"SZ9RRXQC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Robertson","lastName":"Lucy J."},{"firstName":"Clark","lastName":" C.

Opinions regarding whether pathogenic enteric protozoa may be transmitted between wildlife and humans have been shaped by our investigation tools, and have led to oscillations regarding whether particular species are zoonotic or have host-adapted life cycles. When the only approach for identifying enteric protozoa was morphology, it was assumed that many enteric protozoa colonized multiple hosts and were probably zoonotic. When molecular tools revealed genetic differences in morphologically identical species colonizing humans and other animals, host specificity seemed more likely. Parasites from animals found to be genetically identical - at the few genes investigated - to morphologically indistinguishable parasites from human hosts, were described as having zoonotic potential. More discriminatory molecular tools have now sub-divided some protozoa again. Meanwhile, some infection events indicate that, circumstances permitting, some “host-specific” protozoa, can actually infect various hosts. These repeated changes in our understanding are linked intrinsically to the investigative tools available. Here we review how molecular tools have assisted, or sometimes confused, our understanding of the public health threat from nine enteric protozoa and example wildlife hosts (Balantoides coli - wild boar; Blastocystis sp. - wild rodents; Cryptosporidium spp. - wild fish; Encephalitozoon spp. - wild birds; Entamoeba spp. - non-human primates; Enterocytozoon bieneusi - wild cervids; Giardia duodenalis - red foxes; Sarcocystis nesbitti - snakes; Toxoplasma gondii - bobcats). Molecular tools have provided evidence that some enteric protozoa in wildlife may infect humans, but due to limited discriminatory power, often only the zoonotic potential of the parasite is indicated. Molecular analyses, which should be as discriminatory as possible, are one, but not the only, component of the toolbox for investigating potential public health impacts from pathogenic enteric protozoa in wildlife.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"323-341","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Zoonosis","Transmission","Emerging infection","Host specificity","Protozoa","Wildlife"]},{"key":"XJKB5NKV","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Aghahosseini","lastName":"Arman"},{"firstName":"Bogdanov","lastName":" Dmitrii"},{"firstName":"Barbosa","lastName":" Larissa S.

The deployment of renewable energy, especially solar and wind power, decreases carbon dioxide emissions, but presents issues of resource intermittency. In this study, a cost-optimised 100% renewable energy based system is analysed and quantified for the Americas for the reference year 2030 using high spatially and temporally resolved weather data. Several scenarios have been applied, from a decentralised power system towards a fully centralised and interconnected system, taking into account a mix of renewable energy, energy storage and transmission networks. This research aims to evaluate the benefits of an interconnected energy system for the Americas. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is between 48.8 and 59.0 €/MWh depending on the chosen scenario. The results show that the LCOE and total annualised cost drop by 14% and 15%, respectively, in a centralised power system. The optimised utilisation of transmission grids leads to less energy storage requirement. Sector coupling brings further benefits by reducing additional 4% of LCOE, where electricity demand for power, seawater desalination and non-energetic industrial gas sectors have been supplied. A comparison between the interconnected Americas and North and South America individually shows a reduction of 1.6% and 4.0% for the total annual system cost and LCOE. Although the cost of the energy system decreased due to wide grid interconnection, substantial benefits have not been achieved as reported earlier for a Pan-American energy system. A scenario with synthetic natural gas (SNG) trading through a liquefied natural gas value chain has also been presented. The results suggest that local SNG production cost in the assumed consumption centre is almost the same as the cost of imported SNG.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"187-205","language":"en","automatic_tags":["SouthAmerica","North America","Energy storage","Grid interconnection","Hourly resolved spatial-temporal data","Renewable energy system"]},{"key":"SQMUGQHG","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Kahhat","lastName":"Ramzy"},{"firstName":"Parodi","lastName":" Eduardo"},{"firstName":"Larrea-Gallegos","lastName":" Gustavo"},{"firstName":"Mesta","lastName":" Carlos"},{"firstName":"Vázquez-Rowe","lastName":" Ian"}],"title":"Environmental impacts of the life cycle of alluvial gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.246","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719302736","abstract_note":"Alluvial gold mining activities in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest are responsible for mercury emissions and deforestation.

Results show that animal manure as a source of biogas may be associated with an overall biogas potential of 27.1 Mm3 year−1 with an equivalent installed power capacity of 6.8 MWe.

There are extensive areas of sandy soils under cultivation, but the soil fertility is often low and dependent on the levels of soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we review SOC levels of sandy soils across the world using pedon databases, data from literature, and three detailed case studies. Pedons were selected from five major databases and the pedons had a minimum of 850g sand kg−1 in the top 30cm. Sandy soils occur in all climates and several soil orders (mainly Alfisols, Entisols, Inceptisols, Spodosols, Ultisols). Soil organic carbon was highest in sandy soils of the temperate and cold zones (mean 19gkg−1), and lowest in soils of the arid zone (<5gkg−1). The SOC concentrations was highest when mean annual precipitation was between 700 and 1300mm, and SOC was lower when annual temperatures were higher. Sandy soils under forest had on average 23g SOC kg−1 whereas the soils under prairie had on average 7g SOC kg−1. Spodosols had the highest SOC concentrations, and SOC was lowest in Aridisols. The average A-horizon thickness of sandy soils was 17cm, and it was thickest in Mollisols, and thinnest in Inceptisols. The thickness of the A-horizon is important since most of the SOC of sandy soils is found in the A-horizon. Over 32,000 papers have been published on sandy soils since 1914, and in the past 10 years, some 1000–1800 papers are annually published on sandy soils. We extracted papers since the early 1990s, and grouped them by continent, land cover, soil order, and focus of the research. Three soil-forming processes have been extensively studied in relation to SOC and sandy soils: podzolization, humification, and melanization. Several studies found that SOC increases when sandy soils were fertilized, but sandy soils become more water repellent with an increase in SOC and a decrease in pH. From published literature, it was found that SOC was high in sandy soils under forest (≤90gkg−1) and grassland (≤187gkg−1), and low in sandy soils under agriculture (≤38gkg−1) or under shrub (≤36gkg−1). Lastly, we present case studies from Southern Africa, Western Europe, and North America. Sandy soils cover about 273 million ha in Africa, and SOC rarely exceeds 10g SOC kg−1 in the top 30cm. The plaggen soils of Western Europe have high SOC (up to 66gkg−1) due to the long-term additions of sod, litter, manure, and sea sand to increase the soil fertility. In the Wisconsin Central Sand Plains, SOC stocks in soils under agriculture were high (60Mgha−1) compared to the soils under forest (15Mgha−1) and grassland (25Mgha−1). Available water capacity increased with an increase in SOC. From this review, we conclude that sandy soils are found throughout the world, and the sandy soils in the temperate and cold zones have the highest SOC levels. In sandy soils, soil organic carbon increased the cation exchange capacity and lowered the bulk density. Soil organic carbon levels can be significantly increased in sandy soils under agriculture when amendments are made in combination with irrigation.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"217-310","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Carbonsequestration","Soil organic carbon","Arenosols","Climate zone","Land cover","Plaggen","Psamments","Soil management"]},{"key":"A7DJCK4R","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Du","lastName":"Zhiheng"},{"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":" Cunde"},{"firstName":"Furdui","lastName":" Vasile I."},{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":" Wangbin"}],"title":"The perchlorate record during 1956–2004 from Tienshan ice core, East Asia","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.456","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718348113","abstract_note":"Perchlorate concentration in a shallow ice core at Tienshan, East Asia ranged between 0.55 and 52.1 ng L−1, with significant temporal variations during 1956–2004.

Although differences in trends and amounts were observed, the 1956–2004 perchlorate data from this study compares well with the perchlorate data from the High Arctic ice cores. The spatial and temporal differences of the perchlorate in Miaoergou ice core may be due to differences in anthropogenic sources. Such as, the nitrate ore field in Turpan-Hami Basin in eastern Xinjiang, China, may be the primary anthropogenic source. From the organic chlorine species emission data, HCFC-141b, HCFC-142b and HCFC-124 were identified as the primary anthropogenic sources responsible for the two perchlorate spikes observed for 1980–1996 and 1997–2001.

Although soil microbiota facilitate organic P turnover and inorganic P mobilization, their role in carbon-phosphorus coupled processes remains poorly understood. To advance this topic, soils collected from four sites representing highly weathered tropical soils in the El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico were incubated with exogenous PO43− under controlled laboratory conditions. P amendment increased CO2 respiration by 14–23% relative to control incubations for soils sampled from all but the site with the greatest total and bioavailable soil P. Metatranscriptomics revealed an increase in the relative transcription of genes involved in cell growth and uptake of other nutrients in response to P amendment. A new methodology to normalize gene expression by population-level relative (DNA) abundance revealed that the pattern of increased transcription of cell growth and division genes with P amendment was community-wide. Soil communities responsive to P amendment possessed a greater relative abundance of α-glucosyl polysaccharide biosynthesis genes, suggestive of enhanced C storage under P-limiting conditions. Phosphorylase genes governing the degradation of α-glucosyl polysaccharides were also more abundant and increased in relative transcription with P amendment, indicating a shift from energy storage towards growth. Conversely, microbial communities in soils nonresponsive to P amendment were found to have metabolisms tuned for the phosphorolysis of labile plant-derived substrates, such as β-glucosyl polysaccharides. Collectively, our results provided quantitative estimates of increased soil respiration upon alleviation of P constraints and elucidated several underlying ecological and molecular mechanisms involved in this response.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"43-54","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Tropicalecosystem","Enzyme activities","Metagenomics","Metatranscriptomics","Microbial ecology","Phosphorus limitation","Soil respiration"]},{"key":"SKECP5FX","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"vanden Burg","lastName":" S.

The aim of this paper is to provide a single source document that summarizes the probable boundaries of marine growth industries, namely aquaculture; offshore wind energy with fixed foundations; floating offshore wind energy; tidal and wave energy; marine biotechnology, seabed mining; and tourism and recreation, based on depth and distance from the shore. This is an important first step in developing a single source document for marine industry boundaries that will help marine spatial planners and researchers develop innovative industry combinations to foster growth in the marine sector.

By describing the geographical characteristics of different sea basins, this paper helps to focus marine governance strategies for stimulating combinations of marine industries towards the most promising areas.

Using six experimental datasets including broadleaf species samples of >150 species collected over tropical, temperate and boreal ecosystems, we compared the performances of a physically-based method (PROSPECT model inversion) and a ML algorithm (support vector machine regression, SVM) to infer EWT and LMA based on leaf reflectance and transmittance. We assessed several merit functions to invert PROSPECT based on iterative optimization and investigated the spectral domain to be used for optimal estimation of LMA and EWT. We also tested several strategies to select the training samples used by the SVM, in order to investigate the generalization ability of the derived regression models. We evidenced that using spectral information from 1700 to 2400 nm leads to strong improvement in the estimation of EWT and LMA when performing a PROSPECT inversion, decreasing the LMA and EWT estimation errors by 55% and 33%, respectively. The comparison of various sampling strategies for the training set used with SVM suggests that regression models show limited generalization ability, particularly when the regression model is applied on data fully independent from the training set. Finally, our results demonstrate that, when using an appropriate spectral domain, the PROSPECT inversion outperforms SVM trained with experimental data for the estimation of EWT and LMA. Thus we recommend that estimation of LMA and EWT based on leaf optical properties should be physically-based using inversion of reflectance and transmittance measurements on the 1700 to 2400 nm spectral range.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"110959","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Vegetation","Biophysical properties","EWT","Leaf spectroscopy","LMA","Radiative transfer model","Support vector machine"]},{"key":"VGBM8V6U","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Parreira","lastName":"Micael Rosa"},{"firstName":"Nabout","lastName":" João Carlos"},{"firstName":"Tessarolo","lastName":" Geiziane"},{"firstName":"de Souza Lima-Ribeiro","lastName":" Matheus"},{"firstName":"Teresa","lastName":" Fabrício Barreto"}],"title":"Disentangling uncertainties from niche modeling in freshwater ecosystems","publication_title":"Ecological Modelling","issn":"0304-3800","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.10.024","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380018303612","abstract_note":"Predictions by ecological niche models (ENM) are affected by several sources of uncertainty including the modeling methods and type of variables employed.

Here, we used the ecologically and economically relevant Amazon giant catfish (Brachyplatystoma filamentosum) as a model species to assess uncertainties on ENM predictions in freshwater ecosystems. Specifically, we assessed uncertainty by coupling ENM predictions using five modeling methods and four sets of freshwater environmental variables. Our results indicate that the modeling methods and secondarily the variables account for significant uncertainty in predicting freshwater species distribution using ENM. Areas with high environmental suitability such as the Amazon large rivers and nearby areas presented high uncertainty for the methods component, and lower uncertainties for freshwater variables. Moreover, freshwater variables accounted also for uncertainties in metrics of models’ performance. Whereas Topographic variables better predicted presences (higher sensitivities and lower omission errors), Land cover and Soil variables better predicted pseudo-absences (higher specificities and lower commission errors). The Hydroclimatic variables had better accuracy metrics values (AUC and TSS) but also generated the greatest uncertainty for the final models. When included variables from all groups, ENMs presented low uncertainties and good accuracy. In sum, our findings suggest the importance of measuring and mapping the uncertainties of ENMs using freshwater environmental database.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"1-8","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazonecoregions","Factorial ANOVA","Predictors variables","Species distribution"]},{"key":"JMR3K6S8","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Pratolongo","lastName":"Paula"},{"firstName":"Leonardi","lastName":" Nicoletta"},{"firstName":"Kirby","lastName":" Jason R."},{"firstName":"Plater","lastName":" Andrew"}],"title":"Chapter 3 - Temperate Coastal Wetlands: Morphology, Sediment Processes, and Plant Communities","publication_title":"Coastal Wetlands (Second Edition)","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444638939000034","abstract_note":"Temperate coastal wetlands include a large variety of environments, from tidal flats and salt marshes to nontidal wetlands at the landward edge, whose hydrology is still influenced by mean sea level. Salt marsh evolution and accretion depends on several factors, and different models aim to reproduce the physical and ecological processes driving marsh evolution by using different levels of simplification. In response to the environmental gradients imposed by elevation, salt marsh plants commonly exhibit clear patterns of shore-parallel zonation of species. In low marsh areas, salinity is comparatively low because of regular tidal flushing, but soil salinity levels vary across marsh elevations. In humid warm regions, freshwater input from rain and upland sources moderates salinity at the terrestrial border, but salts can concentrate by evaporation at intermediate marsh elevations. In humid climates, the upper salt marsh commonly grades into freshwater communities. In arid climates, salt flats devoid of vascular vegetation develop near the upland boundary. Typical patterns of salt marsh plant zonation present substantial differences among major geographic regions, largely reflecting rainfall amount and seasonality, along with the biogeographic distribution of species. In addition, human activities have also exerted profound changes in coastal wetlands, and the processes of wetland loss and degradation have been quite variable in space and time, leading to major regional differences in the extent and ecological integrity of remaining wetland areas. Major human impacts are associated with land claims and alterations of fluvial sediment transport.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"105-152","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Environmentalgradients","Perimarine wetlands","Salt marshes","Sea level"]},{"key":"BE84VUYZ","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Twilley","lastName":"Robert R."},{"firstName":"Rivera-Monroy","lastName":" Victor H."},{"firstName":"Rovai","lastName":" Andre S."},{"firstName":"Castañeda-Moya","lastName":" Edward"},{"firstName":"Davis","lastName":" Stephen"}],"title":"Chapter 21 - Mangrove Biogeochemistry at Local to Global Scales Using Ecogeomorphic Approaches","publication_title":"Coastal Wetlands (Second Edition)","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444638939000216","abstract_note":"Mangrove-dominated estuaries and coastlines contribute significantly to biogeochemical processes at local, regional, and global scales. This review will utilize multiple conceptual models to test how mangrove geomorphological settings (muddy, estuarine, and carbonate coasts) are related to patterns of nutrient biogeochemistry and how disturbances influence these processes over time and space. The ecogeomorphology model describes mangrove wetlands along a hierarchical scale from local multigradient interactions to regional sedimentary environments and to global patterns of climatic and biogeographic constraints. As an example, nitrogen is potentially limiting in many locations where sediment deposition provides sufficient soil phosphorus (P) density to saturate growth conditions, whereas P is more limiting in karstic mangrove settings, reflecting the influence of geomorphological setting on the ecology of mangrove wetlands. Next, the geochemical model provides ecological links along fringe and inland zones where resource and regulator gradients across soil redox zones vary with depth and season. These models can be used in combination to explain biogeochemical variation among coastal settings, such as sulfate reduction and iron availability affecting growth conditions as either a regulator (i.e., sulfide as a plant stressor) or resource (i.e., P availability). Carbon budgets suggest that a large fraction of mangrove organic matter is buried or consumed locally, and the importance of mangrove detritus is related to the ratio of wetland area to open water. Export of mangrove C (with an approximate C:N of 117) is less than previously thought, and much of the C exchange via tides may actually be equally distributed among dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic (DIC) carbon. Based on reviews, wood production is about 240gCm−2 per year, and the average C sequestration in mangroves soils is about 163gCm−2 per year. The sum of these two measures (NPPW+ΔSorg) is then a mean approximation of mangrove net ecosystem production. Tides are a significant hydrological process driving fluxes of water and solute in mangroves. At a local scale, crab burrows greatly enhance the sediment interface, affecting gas exchange and tidal pumping of DIC. Mangrove creek water is often highly saturated with respect to CO2 and a net source to the atmosphere, with an average efflux of 59±52mmolm−2 per day. Dark fluxes from sediments average 61±46mmolm−2 per day (n=82) while about half of the available flux data under light conditions show a net CO2 uptake of −15±54mmolm−2 per day (n=14). This DIC signal in tidal creek and estuarine waters may be even more significant in settings that receive less river input such as lagoons and carbonate environments. In these cases, the net tidal exchange of DIC from mangroves may be more significant than a river contribution. Geographic location and regional climate of major mangrove forests may explain carbon exchange with nearshore coastal waters (e.g., the wet tropics compared with drier low-latitude regions). Coastal environmental setting also affects the form (e.g., DIC, DOC) and magnitude of carbon exchange between mangrove forests and nearshore coastal waters. Total organic carbon in the net tidal exchange from mangroves to the estuary becomes a carbon sink depending on how much of this organic carbon is respired back to the atmosphere. Most estuaries are considered heterotrophic, and thus much of this mangrove carbon is not buried in the coastal zone. This is still a major question in the carbon budget of coastal ecosystems, but there have been some very interesting discoveries in the last decade.

Overlay analyses were conducted inside and outside of existing PANs to determine the proportions of natural and plantation (monoculture) forests. Proportions of this species group’s climate space projected to be critical for conservation (combination of stable and expanding zones or ‘Z4’) that are under forest cover were also calculated. Approximately 63% of Trinidad is forested, with the majority of plantation forests located within the PAN, producing noticeable areas of cleared forest when harvested. The ENM projected a drastic reduction in climate space for this group of high-conservation-value tree species across the island. However, approximately 54% of the Z4 space was projected to occur within the PAN; and 61% of the Z4 falling outside the PAN was under forest cover. Consequently, conservation of this species group could be greatly enhanced by increasing the proportion of its Z4 climate space outside the PAN under maintained forest/secondary vegetation cover. Given the small size of small island states (SIS) (such as those in the Caribbean) relative to the macro-scale of climate change, a more effective means of managing climate-induced species loss could involve the development of regional-scale PANs rather than separate efforts of individual SIS.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"185-193","language":"en","automatic_tags":["biodiversity","Caribbean","climate change","protected areas","environmental niche modelling","Small island"]},{"key":"TYSIZPGI","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Becken","lastName":"Susanne"},{"firstName":"Shuker","lastName":" Jon"}],"title":"A framework to help destinations manage carbon risk from aviation emissions","publication_title":"Tourism Management","issn":"0261-5177","doi":"10.1016/j.tourman.2018.10.023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517718302589","abstract_note":"Global tourism is booming, and so is demand for air travel.

For this purpose, detection and delineation of individual tree crowns (ITCs) is a prerequisite. Here, we present a new method of automatic tree crown delineation based only on very high resolution images from WorldView-2 satellite and apply it to a region of the Atlantic rain forest with highly heterogeneous tropical canopy cover – the Santa Genebra forest reserve in Brazil. The method works in successive steps that involve pre-processing, selection of forested pixels, enhancement of borders, detection of pixels in the crown borders, correction of shade in large trees and, finally, segmentation of the tree crowns. Principally, the method uses four techniques: rolling ball algorithm and mathematical morphological operations to enhance the crown borders and ease the extraction of tree crowns; bimodal distribution parameters estimations to identify the shaded pixels in the gaps, borders, and crowns; and focal statistics for the analysis of neighbouring pixels. Crown detection is validated by comparing the delineated ITCs with a sample of ITCs delineated manually by visual interpretation. In addition, to test if the spectra of individual species are conserved in the automatic delineated crowns, we compare the accuracy of species prediction with automatic and manual delineated crowns with known species. We find that our method permits detection of up to 80% of ITCs. The seven species with over 10 crowns identified in the field were mapped with reasonable accuracy (30.5–96%) given that only WorldView-2 bands and texture features were used. Similar classification accuracies were obtained using both automatic and manual delineation, thereby confirming that species’ spectral responses are preserved in the automatic method and thus permitting the recognition of species at the landscape scale. Our method might support tropical forest applications, such as mapping species and canopy characteristics at the landscape scale.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"362-377","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Tropicalforests","Image segmentation","Mathematical morphology","Multispectral image","Rolling ball algorithm","Species identification"]},{"key":"F5QUIKKL","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2019","author":[{"firstName":"Barletta","lastName":"Mário"},{"firstName":"Lima","lastName":" André R.

In the present review, especial attention is given to estuaries in South America (SA), where legislation, policies and actions to guarantee environmental quality remain ineffective. There, the majority of estuaries face uncontrolled occupation of its margins by urban and industrial centres, agriculture and aquaculture expansion, water extraction and flow control. The lack of basic sanitation and poor environmental management (including territories within Marine Protected Areas) often lead to hydrological alterations, high nutrient loads, and the presence and dynamics of pollutants (nutrient loads, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), metals and plastic debris) along the entire estuarine ecocline. Organic enrichment has increased dissolved oxygen consumption, with wide spatio-temporal variability along latitudes and estuarine gradients. The toxicity, biogeochemistry and availability of metals and POPs depend on the annual fluctuations of salinity, water renewal, dissolved oxygen levels, suspended particulate loads, sediment mobility, grain size and composition at the sink. Plastic debris from land sources are widespread in estuaries, where they continue to fragment into microplastics. River basins are the main contributors of plastics to estuaries, whose transportation and accumulation are subjected to interannual water flow variations. Although some systems seems to be in a better condition in relation to others around the world (e.g. Goiana and Negro estuaries), many others are among the most modified worldwide (e.g. Guanabara Bay and Estero Salado System). We propose that, estuarine conservation plans should consider year-round fluctuations of the ecocline and the resulting cycles of retention and flush of environmental signals and their influence on trophic webs over the whole extent of estuarine gradients.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"1199-1218","language":"en","automatic_tags":["bioaccumulation","Environmental pollution","estuarine conservation","estuarine processes","metals","microplastic","persistent pollutants"]},{"key":"ABD6GLIW","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Weiss","lastName":"Carlos V.

However, for mid to long-term marine energy development planning, a comprehensive assessment of the global potential for the exploitation of the main offshore resources is required. This work developed and implemented an innovative methodological approach to identify potential zones for wind and wave energy exploitation at the global level, using long-term data series with fine spatial and temporal resolution. The proposed methodology was based on a five-step approach comprised of: (i) a resource assessment, to identify the zones with favorable conditions for energy exploitation; (ii) a structural survivability assessment, to identify feasible areas which would likely ensure the integrity and durability of the wind and wave devices; (iii) a logistics assessment, to evaluate the possibility of carrying out installation, operations, and maintenance activities; (iv) an assessment of the distance to consumer centers, to estimate the feasibility of transmission to the main urban areas; and (v) an estimate of the extractable power of the identified potential zones. For wind power, the United Kingdom (with 1470 TWh/month using a 10-MW turbine) and the United States (1079 TWh/month) were the countries with the highest estimated energy output of the identified potential zones. For wave energy, Brazil and New Zealand presented good opportunities for the development of the wave energy industry, with an estimated extractable power of 372 TWh/month and 286 TWh/month, respectively. The unique preliminary global analysis presented in this work provides guidelines to assist in the development of wave and offshore wind industries, in addition to supporting the management of marine spaces. Moreover, the methodologies can be replicated for other marine activities.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"43-54","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Availableresources","Co-location","Logistics activities","Offshore renewable energies","Potential zones","Structural survivability"]},{"key":"IKXQSSRH","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Souza","lastName":"M.

This paper attempts to re-explore such a link by focusing on malaria, a major infectious disease. We argue that in resource-rich countries the reluctance of governments to invest in human capital, rampant corruption and weakened state capacity, and inferior hygiene conditions in mining and drilling areas lead to higher numbers of cases of malaria. To provide empirical support, we apply different natural resource measures, and examine their impacts on the number of cases of infection and death from malaria for the period 2000–2014. Statistical results largely confirm our observations that natural resource abundance is positively associated with a higher number of incidences of and deaths from malaria.

There is a tropical maritime (dry season) between January and May and a moist equatorial (wet season) between June and December. The coastal zone supports biologically diverse, highly productive ecosystems associated with mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, mudflats, estuaries, lagoons, and littoral woodlands. However, the development of heavy industry and high population density in the coastal areas has increased the pollution levels in the coastal zones causing significant pressure on these fragile ecosystems. Trinidad and Tobago has signed several important international conventions and programs which are geared to protect the marine and environment. However, the record of implementing the provisions of these conventions is very poor. As such, there is no marine management plan. Instead, management is guided by a number of sectoral policies, under different Acts of Parliament, some of which are poorly drafted or date back to colonial times, before sustainability and environmental protection were part of national policy. These legislations are scattered across many different agencies, and responsibilities are often not clearly defined. This is partly due to a general institutional weakness, resource limitations, staffing, lack of communication and coordination between agencies, and the low priority given to the natural environment.

With the objective of drawing the attention of scholars and policy makers to answer the question why effectiveness of selective logging practice is still an issue, we tracked the trend and pattern of scholarly research related to the impact of selective logging. Using a systematic review of literature, we explored and discussed the possible factors hindering implementation of improved forest harvesting practices and the overall knowledge gaps yet not explored in this field of research. This review found consensus among scholars that implementation of improved forest harvesting is still rare despite the constant efforts made by researchers since the 1970s. Based on the review findings we concluded that concentration of research on specific countries, insufficient coverage of diversified forest dimensions/thematic areas, and higher concerns relating to ecological impacts of forest management are the reasons behind poor adoption of research outcomes of improved logging practices. Likewise, their implementation is further hindered by limited attention to the interests and needs of the forest managers/owners, lack of coordination and collaboration among stakeholders and negligible support to develop stakeholders’ capacity. Our review suggests a broadening of the geographical and thematic focus of the study as well as a consideration of effective engagement and capacity development of the forest managers/owners and stakeholders in selective logging policies and practices.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"166-175","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Forestdegradation","Carbon sequestration","Biodiversity conservation","Forest harvesting","Forest policy","Reduced- impact logging","Timber recovery"]},{"key":"FA59WNNW","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Picard","lastName":"Nicolas"},{"firstName":"Gamarra","lastName":" Javier G.

Models derived from point process theory provided a better fit to data from twenty spatially homogeneous sites in tropical rain forests than the commonly used Taylor power model for biomass variance. The model CV = ω+κ/|A| with CV the coefficient of variation of biomass, |A| the plot area, and ω and κ parameters to estimate, provided in particular a better fit than the power model when the range of autocorrelation in biomass was greater than the plot width. The twenty tropical forest sites greatly differed in the observed relationship between biomass variance and plot size, reflecting differences in the spatial pattern of biomass according to the fitted point process. Accordingly, optimized forest inventory designs also greatly differed between forest sites, with positive biomass autocorrelation favouring cluster sampling design with a distance between subplots in the order of the range of the biomass autocorrelation. In a spatially heterogeneous context consisting of different homogeneous forest strata, large-scale heterogeneity prevailed upon local biomass autocorrelation in determining the optimized plot size and shape.

To achieve this, a dynamic bioeconomic model and model-based scenarios are considered, in which the stock's growth function depends on the sea surface temperature. The model is empirically calibrated for the French Guiana shrimp fishery using time series collected over the period 1993–2009. Three fishing effort strategies are then compared under two contrasted IPCC climate scenarios (RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6). A first harvesting strategy maintains the Status Quo in terms of fishing effort. A more ecologically-oriented strategy based on the closure of the fishery is also considered. A third strategy, which relates to Maximum Economic Yield (MEY), is based on the optimisation of the net present value derived from fishing. The results first show that ‘Status Quo’ fishing intensity combined with global warming leads to the collapse of the fishery in the long run. Secondly, it turns out that the Closure strategy preserves stock viability especially under the optimistic climate scenario. Thirdly, the MEY strategy makes it possible to satisfy bioeconomic performances requirements with positive stock and profit, once again, especially under the optimistic warming scenario. Consequently, MEY emerges as a relevant bioeconomic strategy in terms of adaptation to climate change but only in connection with climate change mitigation.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"52-61","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","Adaptation","Renewable resources","Shrimp","Climate scenarios","Fishery bioeconomic model"]},{"key":"HV4Z5H8D","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Piponiot","lastName":"Camille"},{"firstName":"Derroire","lastName":" Géraldine"},{"firstName":"Descroix","lastName":" Laurent"},{"firstName":"Mazzei","lastName":" Lucas"},{"firstName":"Rutishauser","lastName":" Ervan"},{"firstName":"Sist","lastName":" Plinio"},{"firstName":"Hérault","lastName":" Bruno"}],"title":"Assessing timber volume recovery after disturbance in tropical forests – A new modelling framework","publication_title":"Ecological Modelling","issn":"0304-3800","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.05.023","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380018301960","abstract_note":"One third of contemporary tropical forests is designated by national forest services for timber production. Tropical forests are also increasingly affected by anthropogenic disturbances. However, there is still much uncertainty around the capacity of tropical forests to recover their timber volume after logging as well as other disturbances such as fires, large blow-downs and extreme droughts, and thus on the long-term sustainability of logging. We developed an original Bayesian hierarchical model of Volume Dynamics with Differential Equations (VDDE) to infer the dynamic of timber volumes as the result of two ecosystem processes: volume gains from tree growth and volume losses from tree mortality. Both processes are expressed as explicit functions of the forest maturity, i.e. the overall successional stage of the forest that primarily depends on the frequency and severity of the disturbances that the forest has undergone. As a case study, the VDDE model was calibrated with data from Paracou, a long-term disturbance experiment in a neotropical forest where over 56 ha of permanent forest plots were logged with different intensities and censused for 31 years. With this model, we could predict timber recovery at Paracou at the end of a cutting cycle depending on the logging intensity, the rotation cycle length, and the proportion of commercial volume. The VDDE modelling framework developed presents three main advantages: (i) it can be calibrated with large tree inventories which are widely available from national forest inventories or logging concession management plans and are easy to measure, both on the field and with remote sensing; (ii) it depends on only a few input parameters, which can be an advantage in tropical regions where data availability is scarce; (iii) the modelling framework is flexible enough to explicitly include the effect of other types of disturbances (both natural and anthropogenic: e.g. blow-downs, fires and climate change) on the forest maturity, and thus to predict future timber provision in the tropics in a context of global changes.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"353-369","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Sustainability","Disturbance","Ecosystem modelling","Recovery","Tropical forest management"]},{"key":"ELEZMLJP","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"daSilva","lastName":" Ricardo Siqueira"},{"firstName":"Kumar","lastName":" Lalit"},{"firstName":"Shabani","lastName":" Farzin"},{"firstName":"Ribeiro","lastName":" Arthur Vieira"},{"firstName":"Picanço","lastName":" Marcelo Coutinho"}],"title":"Dry stress decreases areas suitable for Neoleucinodes elegantalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and affects its survival under climate predictions in South America","publication_title":"Ecological Informatics","issn":"1574-9541","doi":"10.1016/j.ecoinf.2018.06.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954118300864","abstract_note":"Projections of climate change show some regions of the world getting warmer, colder, dryer or wetter. Consequently, the effects of climate change on insect pests can alter the threat to agricultural systems. As a result of changed climate, areas can become more or less suitable for insect pests. Neoleucinodes elegantalis is one of the major pests of solanaceous crops in South America. Host plants for N. elegantalis are widely present in South America, however, N. elegantalis is absent from many regions in South America. Hence, future climate effects on suitability for development and spread of N. elegantalis in South America should be investigated. Due to these reasons, we developed a model of the climate for N. elegantalis using CLIMEX software for South America using A2 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) for 2030, 2050, 2070 and 2100 and using two models, CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC-H. The results of both models indicate that areas in South America that are climatically suitable at the present time will become climatically unsuitable for N. elegantalis by 2100 as a consequence of progressive increase of dry stress. This was confirmed using developmental bioassays, where survival was lowest at low relative humidity levels. There are also altering areas that are currently unsuitable that become suitable in the future. These results are helpful in developing future strategies to take advantage of new opportunities in solanaceous crops in regions that may be unsuitable for N. elegantalis and provide important information for anticipated possible risks of infestation of N. elegantalis.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"103-113","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Climatechange","CLIMEX","Small tomato borer","Solanaceae"]},{"key":"QJT9NM9P","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Bouimetarhan","lastName":"Ilham"},{"firstName":"Chiessi","lastName":" Cristiano M."},{"firstName":"González-Arango","lastName":" Catalina"},{"firstName":"Dupont","lastName":" Lydie"},{"firstName":"Voigt","lastName":" Ines"},{"firstName":"Prange","lastName":" Matthias"},{"firstName":"Zonneveld","lastName":" Karin"}],"title":"Intermittent development of forest corridors in northeastern Brazil during the last deglaciation: Climatic and ecologic evidence","publication_title":"Quaternary Science Reviews","issn":"0277-3791","doi":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2018.05.026","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379118301847","abstract_note":"The semi-arid northeastern (NE) Brazil vegetation is largely dominated by Caatinga, one of the largest and richest dry forests in the world. Caatinga is a strategic biome, since it has borders with Cerrado, Atlantic forests and the Amazon, acting as a potential corridor (or barrier) for biotic interchange between these regions during evolutionary times. Therefore, accurate reconstructions of past vegetation, ecological and hydrological changes in this area are critical to understanding the dynamics of biome boundaries that may play an important role in dispersal and diversification mechanisms and, more specifically, the link between the long-term climate variability and tropical biodiversity. Here, we present high-resolution palynological and elemental data from marine core GeoB16205-4 retrieved off the Parnaíba River mouth (NE Brazil) mainly covering the Younger Dryas (YD). We show that the YD interval was predominantly wet in NE Brazil, yet it was not homogenous and two distinct phases could be distinguished. A marked intensification of wet conditions between ∼12.3 and 11.6 cal kyr BP was recorded by the expansion of tropical rainforest and tree ferns. These results are in agreement with the transient TraCE-21k coupled climate model simulation. We infer that the second pluvial phase of the YD is related to a weak AMOC due to meltwater pulses in the North Atlantic, which forces a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and its associated rainfall. Our records provide new evidence on the establishment of an “eastern forest corridor” in the nowadays semi-arid Caatinga allowing for past biotic interchanges of plant species.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:09:45","pages":"86-96","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Pollen","Caatinga","Paleoclimate","Northeastern Brazil","Dinocysts","Forest corridor","Younger Dryas"]},{"key":"2CS2IYMM","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"López","lastName":"María S."},{"firstName":"Müller","lastName":" Gabriela V."},{"firstName":"Sione","lastName":" Walter F."}],"title":"Analysis of the spatial distribution of scientific publications regarding vector-borne diseases related to climate variability in South America","publication_title":"Spatial and Spatio-temporal Epidemiology","issn":"1877-5845","doi":"10.1016/j.sste.2018.04.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187758451730117X","abstract_note":"Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive.

The objectives of this work were to analyze the distribution and abundance of publications on vector-borne diseases associated with climate variability in South America, identify those works that conducted a geographic analysis and detect the countries where outbreaks occurred and the climate variables with which they were associated. A systematic review of the literature published on vector-borne diseases linked to climate variability in South America was conducted, identifying, evaluating and summarizing scientific papers. The distribution of the study areas and disease type in the publications were represented on maps. Dengue and leishmaniasis were the most studied and widely represented diseases in South America. The country with the largest number of published papers and presence of all disease types was Brazil. Outbreaks of disease were related to different climate variables. Most diseases from the publications under study occurred in equatorial and tropical climates. The disease represented by the largest number of different types of climates was dengue. The technique used in this work allowed us to determine the status of knowledge of the main diseases associated with climate variability in South America.

Via a critical review of existing hydropower life cycle assessments and reservoir emission studies, we compared the GHG emissions of various types of dams based on their structural type, size, primary function, and geographical location during their construction, operation, and decommissioning phases. Means to improve dam performance and reduce related GHG emissions were identified. It was found that dams with reservoirs usually have much higher GHG emission rates than diversion dams. GHG emissions are mainly generated at the construction and maintenance stages for small-scale run-of-river dams, whereas decomposition of flooded biomass and organic matter in the sediment has the highest GHG emission contribution to large-scale reservoir-based dams. Generally, reservoir-based dams located in boreal and temperate regions have much lower reservoir emissions (3–70 g CO2 eq./kW h) compared with dams located in tropical regions (8–6647 g CO2 eq./kW h). Our analysis shows that although most hydroelectric dams have comparable GHG emissions to other types of renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind energy), electricity produced from tropical reservoir-based dams could potentially have a higher emission rate than fossil-based electricity.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"945-956","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Carbonemission","Dam removal","Diversion hydropower","Hydroelectric dam","Non-powered dam","Pumped-storage","Reservoir flooding"]},{"key":"FCE8LQCU","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Liao","lastName":"Zhanmang"},{"firstName":"He","lastName":" Binbin"},{"firstName":"van Dijk","lastName":" Albert I.

However, because of non-volume decorrelation and other unavoidable errors, the robustness of retrieval heights is sensitive to the spatial baseline of the selected InSAR pairs, which relates forest parameters to measured coherence. Within the context of the random volume over ground (RVoG) model and the three-stage inversion method, we aimed to quantify the influence of spatial baseline on the inversions at P-band, which are distinct from the inversions at higher frequency due to the non-negligible ground contributions. This information assists in optimal baseline selection and the development of robust inversion schemes. Assumptions about the extinction coefficient and additional DTM or DEM were used to reduce the influence of ground contribution on CHM and DTM inversion, respectively. Inversions from published airborne repeat-pass P-band PolInSAR data with four different spatial baselines were validated against LiDAR-derived DTM and CHM data. The results show that a longer spatial baseline performed better in DTM inversion. The longest baseline produced the best R2 of 0.995 and RMSE of 0.555 m, much better than the smallest baseline with an R2 of 0.794 and RMSE of 3.74 m. A threshold height could be identified that determines the overestimation and underestimation of CHM inversion due to the non-volume decorrelation. Different baselines produced different threshold heights, making CHM inversion only accurate for a limited range of forest height around the threshold. The optimal baseline produced a CHM with R2 of 0.605 and RMSE of 2.67 m. Additionally, we found that using multiple baselines has the potential to improve CHM inversion, improving the R2 to 0.827 and RMSE to 0.876 m in our study.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"403-421","language":"en","automatic_tags":["CHM","DTM","P-band","PolInSAR","Spatial baseline"]},{"key":"GGZ85NMT","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Bugnicourt","lastName":"Pierre"},{"firstName":"Guitet","lastName":" Stéphane"},{"firstName":"Santos","lastName":" Valdenira F."},{"firstName":"Blanc","lastName":" Lilian"},{"firstName":"Sotta","lastName":" Eleneide D."},{"firstName":"Barbier","lastName":" Nicolas"},{"firstName":"Couteron","lastName":" Pierre"}],"title":"Using textural analysis for regional landform and landscape mapping, Eastern Guiana Shield","publication_title":"Geomorphology","issn":"0169-555X","doi":"10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.03.017","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X18301272","abstract_note":"Availability of digital elevation models (DEM) of increased spatial resolution has triggered interest in texture-based methods for automated geomorphometry.

Through a principal component analysis, FOTO-extracted textural features were found complementary and combined with six common physiographic criteria (convexity, wetness index, dissection, elevation, and percent of steep and low slopes) calculated from the DEM. This provided a primary semiautomated mapping of 16 classes of landform types. To increase legibility, we aggregated into eight landscape unit classes that were the most similar in terms of texture and relief criteria while being frequently contiguous. The resulting map was compared with existing maps that were, however, more local or of lesser resolution and informative content over the region of interest.

The present European Atlas of the Seas consists of background data layers designed to be displayed as map backdrop, as well as a number of thematic data layers, classified under 8 main categories: geography, nature, tourism, security and safety, people and employment, transport and energy, governance and European policies, fisheries and aquaculture. These can be used to compose customized maps, as user-defined ad hoc indicators, and to probe them with tools such as product-to-product correlations, or time series visualisation. Non-specialist professional users can use such analysis and interpretation capabilities to couple data into ecological and socio-economic indicators for a wide range of applications.

Advancements in the use of mangroves as green infrastructure have resulted in a growing interest in understanding the ecological importance of mangrove stands associated with artificial structures. The question remains as to whether urban mangroves growing alongside hardened barriers (seawalls) differ from the community types originally described, and if so, to what extent does the urban landscape affect their structure and associated function. In order to answer this question, we compared seawall and natural mangrove stands with respect to their relative species contributions to stand complexity, tree diameter, height, leaf size, root density, diameter and tree height size classes, complexity index, and mean stand diameter. Results of this investigation revealed few differences between the structural characteristics of seawall and natural mangrove stands in south Florida and the Neotropical region.

Despite this, above-ground biomass is often poorly quantified, particularly in areas where vegetation structure is complex. Traditional methods for providing accurate estimates involve harvesting vegetation to develop mangrove allometric equations and quantify saltmarsh biomass in quadrats. However broad scale application of these methods may not capture structural variability in vegetation resulting in a loss of detail and estimates with considerable uncertainty. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) collects high resolution three-dimensional point clouds capable of providing detailed structural morphology of vegetation. This study demonstrates that TLS is a suitable non-destructive method for estimating biomass of structurally complex coastal wetland vegetation. We compare volumetric models, 3-D surface reconstruction and rasterised volume, and point cloud elevation histogram modelling techniques to estimate biomass. Our results show that current volumetric modelling approaches for estimating TLS-derived biomass are comparable to traditional mangrove allometrics and saltmarsh harvesting. However, volumetric modelling approaches oversimplify vegetation structure by under-utilising the large amount of structural information provided by the point cloud. The point cloud elevation histogram model presented in this study, as an alternative to volumetric modelling, utilises all of the information within the point cloud, as opposed to sub-sampling based on specific criteria. This method is simple but highly effective for both mangrove (r2 = 0.95) and saltmarsh (r2 > 0.92) vegetation.

In this paper, a clean energy development index evaluation index system with four grades is established from the two aspects of clean energy installed capacity and clean energy generation. Based on the improved entropy method of the sub-section and sub-dimension comprehensive evaluation model and the clean energy installed capacity and clean energy power generation of the year of 2013 and 2014, the absolute, the relative and the incremental development index of various categories of clean energy in different countries is obtained, and then the overall clean energy absolute, the relative and the incremental development index of every country is calculated. Ultimately, the clean energy composite development index is obtained. According to the descriptive statistics analysis method and combined with the characteristics of clean energy development in studied countries, 231 countries are divided into four categories: A++, A+, A, A−. By changing the weight determination method, the efficiency coefficient entropy method is used to verify the level of clean energy development, and the Spearman correlation of the exponential results calculated by different methods is analyzed. The conclusion is drawn that the top 10 countries in the clean energy development index in 2014 are the United States, China, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Kenya, the Philippines, Canada and New Zealand. In fully developed countries, the absolute, the relative and the comprehensive development index of clean energy are relatively high. In emerging countries, the incremental development indexes of clean energy are relatively high, and the emerging countries of the clean energy market have great potential for development.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"305-321","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Cleanenergy","Comprehensive evaluation","Development index","Improved entropy method","Spearman correlation"]},{"key":"HEBZERLC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Aguilos","lastName":"Maricar"},{"firstName":"Hérault","lastName":" Bruno"},{"firstName":"Burban","lastName":" Benoit"},{"firstName":"Wagner","lastName":" Fabien"},{"firstName":"Bonal","lastName":" Damien"}],"title":"What drives long-term variations in carbon flux and balance in a tropical rainforest in French Guiana?","publication_title":"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","issn":"0168-1923","doi":"10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.02.009","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192318300595","abstract_note":"A thorough understanding of how tropical forests respond to climate is important to improve ecosystem process models and to reduce uncertainties in current and future global carbon balance calculations. The Amazon rainforest, a major contributor to the global carbon cycle, is subject to strong intra- and interannual variations in climate conditions. Understanding their effect on carbon fluxes between the ecosystem and the atmosphere and on the resulting carbon balance is still incomplete. We examined the long-term (over a 12-year period; 2004–2015) variations in gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in a tropical rainforest in French Guiana and identified key climatic drivers influencing the changes. The study period was characterized by strong differences in climatic conditions among years, particularly differences in the intensity of the dry and wet seasons, as well as differences in annual carbon fluxes and balance. Annual average GPP varied from 3384.9 g C m−2 yr‒1 (95% CI [3320.7, 3445.9]) to 4061.2 g C m−2 yr‒1 (95% CI [3980.1, 4145.0]). RE varied even more than GPP, with a difference of 933.1 C m−2 yr‒1 between the minimum (3020.6 g C m−2 yr‒1; 95% CI [2889.4, 3051.3]) and maximum (3953.7 g C m−2 yr‒1; 95% CI [3887.6, 4019.6]) values. Although NEE showed large interannual variability (nine-fold), from ‒65.6 g C m−2 yr‒1 (95% CI [‒4.4, ‒126.0]) to ‒590.5 g C m−2 yr‒1 (95% CI [‒532.3, ‒651.6]), the forest remained a carbon sink over the 12-year period. A combination of global radiation (Rg), relative extractable water (REW) and soil temperature (Ts) explained 51% of the daily variations for GPP, 30% for RE and 39% for NEE. Global radiation was always the best predictor of these variations, but soil water content and temperature did also influence carbon fluxes and balance. Seasonally, Rg was the major controlling factor for GPP, RE and NEE during the wet season. During the dry season, variations in carbon fluxes and balance were poorly explained by climate factors. Yet, REW was the key driver of variations in NEE during the dry season. This study highlights that, over the long-term, carbon fluxes and balance in such tropical rainforest ecosystems are largely controlled by both radiation and water limitation. Even though variations in Rg have a greater impact on these fluxes, water limitation during seasonal droughts is enough to reduce ecosystem productivity, respiration and carbon uptake. The reduced precipitation expected in tropical rainforest areas under future climatic conditions will therefore strongly influence carbon fluxes and carbon uptake. This study also highlights the importance for land surface or dynamic global vegetation models to consider the main drivers of carbon fluxes and balance separately for dry and wet seasons.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"114-123","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Ecosystemrespiration","Tropical rainforest","Drought","GPP","NEE","Radiation"]},{"key":"X4YMKGC9","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Stidworthy","lastName":"Mark F."},{"firstName":"Denk","lastName":" Daniela"}],"title":"Chapter 27 - Sphenisciformes, Gaviiformes, Podicipediformes, Procellariiformes, and Pelecaniformes","publication_title":"Pathology of Wildlife and Zoo Animals","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128053065000274","abstract_note":"Penguins are flightless seabirds with unique anatomy.

This includes global sea-level rise (SLR) which has a range of potential impacts including higher extreme sea levels (and flooding), coastal erosion, and salinization of surface and ground waters. This threatens the loss/degradation of large areas of coastal land and associated assets and economic activity, the displacement of millions of people, and significant coastal habitat degradation. There are several adaptation strategies to manage this challenge (e.g., protection, accommodation, planned retreat) and many detailed adaptation options. Their appropriate application can greatly reduce these impacts and promote prosperous and resilient coasts. Adaptation to SLR should take an integrated coastal management philosophy to address wider coastal activities and other stresses. Further, SLR is a long-term issue and adaptation needs are almost certain to grow, indicating the need for a multistep adaptation pathway approach. In addition to technical dimensions, adaptation requires appropriate institutional capacity and commitment. This chapter reviews and evaluates current efforts and needs in coastal adaptation to SLR.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"13-29","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Adaptation","resilience","accommodation","coasts","protection","retreat"]},{"key":"SKVHN7EN","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Macdonald","lastName":"Catriona A."},{"firstName":"Delgado-Baquerizo","lastName":" Manuel"},{"firstName":"Reay","lastName":" David S."},{"firstName":"Hicks","lastName":" Lettice C."},{"firstName":"Singh","lastName":" Brajesh K."}],"title":"Chapter 6 - Soil Nutrients and Soil Carbon Storage: Modulators and Mechanisms","publication_title":"Soil Carbon Storage","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128127667000068","abstract_note":"It is well recognized that the capacity of soils to sequester carbon (C) is strongly influenced by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability because of the strong stoichiometric links between these biogeochemical cycles. Human disturbance (e.g., deposition, fertilization, and mining), has, and continue to have, caused large imbalances between the biogeochemical cycles and changing nutrient availabilities identified as a key uncertainty in predicting future ecosystem C sequestration. Despite this knowledge, key gaps exist in our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the interactions between C and nutrient cycles, which limit our ability to predict the impacts of change on future soil C sequestration. In this chapter, we discuss N, P, and other nutrients as key modulators of soil C storage. We consider two contrasting mechanistic theories—microbial nutrient mining (MNM) theory and basic stoichiometric decomposition theory—driving these modulators, as well as the impact that environment and land-use change is likely to have, and the expected consequences for soil C storage. Overwhelmingly, experimental evidence from the micro- to global-scale support MNM theory as the main mechanism of the impact of nutrients on soil C storage, and suggest that increasing N availability inhibits enzymes responsible for recalcitrant C degradation and thus promotes long-term C storage in soils. A better mechanistic understanding of the interactions between resource and biomass stoichiometry, microbial nutrient use efficiency, and litter chemistry, as well as improved knowledge of P mineralization, sorption, limitation, and stoichiometry is needed to improve parameterization of N- and P cycling into C-cycling models.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"167-205","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Nitrogen","basic stoichiometric decomposition","microbial nutrient mining","phosphorus","soil carbon storage","sulfur"]},{"key":"K7PWTL2Q","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Pugsley","lastName":"Adrian"},{"firstName":"Zacharopoulos","lastName":" Aggelos"},{"firstName":"Mondol","lastName":" Jayanta D."},{"firstName":"Smyth","lastName":" Mervyn"}],"title":"Chapter 2 - Solar Desalination Potential Around the World","publication_title":"Renewable Energy Powered Desalination Handbook","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128152447000027","abstract_note":"Regions most affected by water scarcity and stress tend to be those sustaining high populations and receiving least rainfall.

Sedimentary basins evolved in a wide range of structural settings on both flanks of the Andean magmatic arc, with strong signatures of retroarc crustal shortening, flexure, and rapid accumulation in long-lived foreland and hinterland basins. Extensional basins also formed during pre-Andean backarc extension and locally in selected forearc, arc, and retroarc zones during Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic Andean orogenesis. Major transitions in topography and sediment routing are recovered through provenance studies, particularly detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological applications, which distinguish three principal sediment source regions—the South American craton, Andean magmatic arc, and retroarc fold-thrust belt. Following the cessation of Late Triassic–Early Cretaceous extensional and/or postextensional neutral-stress conditions, a Late Cretaceous-early Paleocene inception of Andean shortening was chronicled in retroarc regions along the western margin by rapid flexural subsidence, a wholesale reversal in drainage patterns, and provenance switch from eastern cratonic sources to Andean sources. An enigmatic Paleogene hiatus in the Andean foreland succession recorded diminished accumulation and/or regional unconformity development, contemporaneous with a phase of limited shortening or neutral to locally extensional conditions. Seemingly contradictory temporal fluctuations in tectonic regimes, defined by contrasting (possibly cyclical) phases of shortening, neutral, and extensional conditions, can be linked to the degree of mechanical coupling along the subduction plate boundary. Along-strike variations in Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic deformation and crustal thickening demonstrate contrasting high-shortening versus low-shortening modes of Andean orogenesis, in which the central Andes are distinguished by large-magnitude east-west shortening (>150–300km) and corresponding cratonward advance of the fold-thrust belt and foreland basin system, several times that of the northern and southern Andes. These temporal and spatial changes in shortening and overall tectonic regime can be related to variable plate coupling during first-order shifts in plate convergence, second-order cycles of slab shallowing and steepening, and second-order cycles of shortening, lithospheric removal and local partial extensional collapse in highly shortened and thickened segments of the orogen.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"279-309","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Orogeny","Andes","Fold-thrust belts","Foreland basins","Sediment provenance","Stratigraphy","Subduction","Tectonics"]},{"key":"EF364YB7","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Birch","lastName":"Traci"},{"firstName":"Reyes","lastName":" Enrique"}],"title":"Forty years of coastal zone management (1975–2014): Evolving theory, policy and practice as reflected in scientific research publications","publication_title":"Ocean & Coastal Management","issn":"0964-5691","doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.12.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569117307160","abstract_note":"Since its implementation as public law in the United States in 1972, the theoretical foundation of coastal management has moved forward in diverse directions.

Phylogenetic analyses recovered 19 lineages clustered into two major clades, both distributed in Central and South America. Hylopezus nattereri, previously considered a subspecies of H. ochroleucus, was consistently recovered as the most divergent lineage within the Grallaricula/Hylopezus/Myrmothera clade.

Although the timing when most modern lineages of the Hylopezus/Myrmothera clade coincides with a period of intense landscape changes in the Neotropics (Plio-Pleistocene), the absence of any significant shifts in diversification rates over the last 20 million years challenges the view that there is a strict causal relationship between intensification of landscape changes and cladogenesis.

No significant difference in stream discharge is observed between bamboo and pine plantation catchments, and between cultivated and tea plantation catchments.

Peak flows increased by a mean of 10±2.8% while low flows decreased by a mean of 7±5.3%. Increased forest cover decreases annual discharges and surface runoff by 13±1.9% and 25±5%, respectively. Weak correlations between forest cover and runoff (r=0.42, p<0.05), mean discharge (r=0.63, p<0.05) and peak discharge (r=0.67, p<0.05) indicate that forest cover alone is not an accurate predictor of hydrological fluxes in East African catchments. The variability in these results supports the need for long-term field monitoring to better understand catchment responses and to improve the calibration of currently used simulation models.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"49-67","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Modeling","Catchment studies","East Africa","Flow regimes","Land use and land cover changes","River discharge","Trend analyses"]},{"key":"EVSHI2FY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Zanella","lastName":"Augusto"},{"firstName":"Geisen","lastName":" Stefan"},{"firstName":"Ponge","lastName":" Jean-François"},{"firstName":"Jagers","lastName":" Gerard"},{"firstName":"Benbrook","lastName":" Charles"},{"firstName":"Dilli","lastName":" Thomas"},{"firstName":"Vacca","lastName":" Andrea"},{"firstName":"Kwiatkowska-Malina","lastName":" Jolanta"},{"firstName":"Aubert","lastName":" Michaël"},{"firstName":"Fusaro","lastName":" Silvia"},{"firstName":"Nobili","lastName":" Maria De"},{"firstName":"Lomolino","lastName":" Giovanna"},{"firstName":"Gomiero","lastName":" Tiziano"}],"title":"Humusica 2, article 17: techno humus systems and global change − three crucial questions","publication_title":"Applied Soil Ecology","issn":"0929-1393","doi":"10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.10.010","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139317302755","abstract_note":"Some soil scientists or biologists (14, one preferring anonymity) answered the three following questions: (1.

New hydrological insights for the region For sites near to aquifer outcrop, REE and Sr signatures (and relatively light δ13C) trace possible vertical recharge from flood basalts directly overlying the GAS. This highlights aquifer vulnerability where confined by fewer basalts and/or having cross-cutting fractures. 14C activities for these waters, however, suggest the impact of this recharge is significantly delayed in reaching the GAS.

Br/Cl signatures (and heavier δ18O, δ2H) in these latter samples appear to reflect a past climatic signature emplaced under more arid conditions; carbon isotope systematics (δ13C, 14C) support that these represent fossil waters, and care must be taken in their water resources management in regard to sustainability of abstraction. δ18O, δ34S (sulfate) signatures confirm hydrological arguments that waters leak out of the base of the GAS aquifer in this locality rather than underlying formations with poorer water quality potentially mixing in, although other deep GAS waters in the region do show this inter-aquifer mixing.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"130-149","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Groundwater","Aquifer sustainability","Aquifer vulnerability","Environmental Tracers (REEs, Br/Cl, B, δB, Sr, Sr/Sr)","Guarani Aquifer System (GAS)","São Paulo State"]},{"key":"426XG2IZ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Sahay","lastName":"Samraj"}],"title":"Climatic variability and dengue risk in urban environment of Delhi (India)","publication_title":"Urban Climate","issn":"2212-0955","doi":"10.1016/j.uclim.2017.10.008","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095517300871","abstract_note":"The paper determines climate variability in Delhi represented by changes in weather pattern and makes an empirical assessment of their impact on dengue incidence by identifying the ‘high risk’ weeks of a year.

Thirty field plots were established in three types of lowland rainforests: alluvial, sandstone hill and heath forests that represent a wide range of AGB density and stand structure. We derived the height percentile and laser penetration variables from the airborne LiDAR and calculated the vegetation indices, tasseled cap transformation values, and the texture measures from Landsat 8 OLI data. We found that there are moderate correlations between the AGB and laser penetration variables from airborne LiDAR data (r=−0.411 to −0.790). For Landsat 8 OLI data, the 6 vegetation indices and the 46 texture measures also significantly correlated with the AGB (r=0.366–0.519). Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to establish the estimation models for independent and combined use of airborne LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI data. The results showed that the model based on a combination of the two remote sensing data achieved the highest accuracy (R2adj=0.81, RMSE=17.36%) whereas the models using Landsat 8 OLI data airborne LiDAR data independently obtained the moderate accuracy (R2adj=0.52, RMSE=24.22% and R2adj=0.63, RMSE=25.25%, respectively).

This paper quantifies the influence of sediment concentration, turbulence and differential particle settling on flocculation through field and laboratory investigations of the Mekong estuary. For concentrations lower than 200mg·L−1, the particles do not exhibit a dynamic response to their environment, while for higher concentrations (up to 3–4g·L−1), particle size and settling velocity increased by more than one order of magnitude. Flocculation by differential settling has not been sufficiently investigated yet, but this study reveals it as a predominant factor for siltation in quiescent environments such as the ones existing in the inner mangrove fringe.

It is challenging to map tropical forests and their spatio-temporal changes because forests are facing fragmentation from human activities (e.g., logging, deforestation), drought, and fire, as well as persistent clouds. Here we present a robust approach to map forests in South America during 2007–2010 and analyze the consistency and uncertainty among eight major forest maps in South America. Greenness-relevant MOD13Q1 NDVI and structure/biomass-relevant ALOS PALSAR time series data recorded 2007 through 2010 were coupled to identify and map forests at 50-m spatial resolution. Both area and spatial comparison were conducted to analyze the consistency and uncertainty of these eight forest maps. Annual 50-m PALSAR/MODIS forest maps were generated during 2007–2010 and the total forest area in South America was about 8.63×106km2 in 2010. Large differences in total forest area (8.2×106km2–12.7×106km2) existed among these forest products, especially in the forest edges, semi-humid tropical, and subtropical regions. Forest products generated under a similar forest definition had similar or even larger variation than those generated with contrasting forest definitions. We also find out that one needs to consider leaf area index as an adjusting factor and use much higher threshold values in the Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF) datasets to estimate forest cover areas. Analyses of PALSAR/MODIS forest maps in 2008/2009 showed a relatively small rate of loss (3.2×104km2year−1) in net forest cover, similar to that of FAO FRA (3.3×104km2year−1), but much higher annual rates of forest loss and gain. The rate of forest loss (0.195×106km2year−1) was higher than that of Global Forest Watch (0.081×106km2year−1). PALSAR/MODIS forest maps showed that more deforestation occurred in the unfragmented forest areas. Caution should be used when using the different forest maps to analyze forest loss and make policies regarding forest ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. The integration of PALSAR and MODIS images during 2007–2010 provides annual maps of forests in South America with improved accuracy and reduced uncertainty.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"73-87","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Tropicalforest","Leaf area index","Biodiversity conservation","ALOS PALSAR","Forest definition","Forest map comparison","User community"]},{"key":"DET2LECP","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Berkunsky","lastName":"I."},{"firstName":"Quillfeldt","lastName":" P."},{"firstName":"Brightsmith","lastName":" D.

The drivers of this situation appear to be manifold and mainly of anthropogenic origin. However, this assessment is based on the last extensive consultation about the conservation situation of parrots carried out in the 1990s. Given the rapid development of anthropogenic threats, updated data are needed to strategize conservation actions. Using a population approach, we addressed this need through a wide-ranging consultation involving biologists, wildlife managers, government agencies and non-governmental conservation organizations. We gathered up-to-date information on threats affecting 192 populations of 96 Neotropical parrot species across 21 countries. Moreover, we investigated associations among current threats and population trends. Many populations were affected by multiple threats. Agriculture, Capture for the Pet Trade, Logging, each of them affected >55% of the populations, suggesting a higher degree of risk than previously thought. In contrast to previous studies at the species level, our study showed that the threat most closely associated with decreasing population trends is now Capture for the local Pet Trade. Other threats associated with decreasing populations include Small-holder Farming, Rural Population Pressure, Nest Destruction by Poachers, Agro-industry Grazing, Small-holder Grazing, and Capture for the international Pet Trade. Conservation actions have been implemented on <20% of populations. Our results highlight the importance of a population-level approach in revealing the extent of threats to wild populations.

They are highly sensitive to climate change, and environmental transformations in these ecosystems are expected. The Sine Saloum estuary is a case of a system affected by global climate change where reduced precipitation and temperature increase have resulted in an inversion of the salinity gradient. Within the estuary, the composition and structure of the larval fish community related to environmental parameters were investigated using neuston and ring trawl nets. Larval fishes were sampled at 16 stations distributed along a salinity and distance-to-the-sea gradient during four field campaigns (November 2013, February, June, and August 2014) covering an annual cycle. This is the first study documenting the spatial and temporal assemblages of fish larvae in an inverse estuary. The total of 41 taxa representing 24 families and 34 genus identified in this study was lower than that of other tropical estuaries. Clupeidae spp. was the dominant taxon, accounting for 28.9% of the total number of fish larvae caught, followed by Gerreidae spp. (21.1%), Hyporamphus picarti (18.8%), Diplodus bellottii (8.9%), Hypleurochilus langi (4.8%), Mugilidae spp. (4.4%), and Gobiidae sp.1 (3.5%). A total of 20 taxa were recorded within the upper estuary region, whereas 29 and 37 taxa were observed in the middle and lower reaches, respectively. While larval fish were captured at all sites and during all seasons, abundances and richness decreased with increasing salinity. Larval fish assemblages also showed a clear vertical structure corresponding to three distinct water strata. Salinity, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen were the variables that best explained the spatial and temporal differences in larval fish assemblages. It is difficult to forecast the future situation for this system but so far, compared to other mangrove estuarine systems, we have observed the loss of freshwater species in favour of species of marine origin. The information provided in the present study is a contribution to the knowledge of tropical biodiversity and modifications of the ichthyoplankton communities in the context of climate change and future green fund action.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"10-26","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Communitystructure","Fish larvae","High salinity","Inverse estuary","Sine Saloum","West Africa"]},{"key":"W32AT4W7","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Gallo","lastName":"Crescenzio"},{"firstName":"Faccilongo","lastName":" Nicola"},{"firstName":"La Sala","lastName":" Piermichele"}],"title":"Clustering analysis of environmental emissions: A study on Kyoto Protocol's impact on member countries","publication_title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","issn":"0959-6526","doi":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.194","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652617316499","abstract_note":"This paper aims to start the study of the effects of the Kyoto Protocol on the agricultural and forestry sector.

A better understanding of the global coupling relationship between urbanization-environment system is therefore of profound significance. Thus, the present paper investigates this relation on account of the data collected from the World Bank for 209 countries and regions all over the world, for the year 2014. We established an integrated evaluation index system and a dynamic coupling coordination degree (CCD) model in order to conduct this empirical study. The main results are following: (1) Economic urbanization is the heaviest factors in the urbanization sub-system, and so does the eco-environment level in eco-environmental sub-system, therefore these 2 factors have a decisive function in realizing the coordinated development of the urbanization process and the eco-environment; (2) CCD values vary widely between countries and regions, both quantitatively and spatially. At both the global and the continental scale, CCD values indicate that the “utmost development” phase has been reached, and at both scales, the classification of countries and regions into 4 CCD evolution stages indicated a pattern of “more in the middle and less at the ends” (with the exception of in Europe and South America). Further, at the global scale, CCD values displayed a “higher in the northern hemisphere and lower in southern; higher in western hemisphere and lower in eastern” spatial distribution pattern, while distribution patterns varied between continents; (3) Whilst income levels do not maintain a linear relation with CCD, they remains an important determinant—higher income levels tend to indicate a more harmonious coordination coupling relationship, and lower income levels tend to indicate the opposite. The findings in this study would be useful to identify the geographical distribution pattern of the coupling relation globally, assisting in the promotion of coordinated development and the realization of sustainable development goals in the future.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"313-327","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Urbanization","Dynamic coordination coupling degree","Eco-environment","Global countries","Spatial differentiation"]},{"key":"PCIS5PLJ","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Shimoda","lastName":"H"},{"firstName":"Kimura","lastName":" T"}],"title":"1.09 - Japanese Space Program","publication_title":"Comprehensive Remote Sensing","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095489103203","abstract_note":"The Japanese Earth Observation Satellite Programs have started in 1977 with the launch of Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS-1; Himawari).

Multiple, previously undefined and regionally pervasive stratigraphic traps have been mapped through a detailed seismo-sedimentary analysis.

Unfortunately, these forests are disappearing worldwide, notably due to aquaculture and the need for space on the shoreline. The mangrove area in Viet Nam decreased substantially until late 90’s, which was a concern for the Vietnamese government. Then, replantation programs were developed in order to protect the shoreline against the erosion; like in northern Viet Nam, where monospecific stands were planted from the mid 90’s. Within this context, our objectives were to determine carbon stocks and carbon burial rates in the soil of a 18years old Kandelia obovata (Sheue, Lui & Yong) mangrove forest. Three plots were set up in the planted mangroves and three in adjacent bare land (without any mangrove) at the mouth of Red River. Three geo-slicers up to 100cm depth were taken in each plot; and in each core, ten soil samples were collected with a 10cm depth interval. Later on, dead and live roots were sorted. Carbon contents in soils and in roots were determined using the Walkley-Black method and loss on ignition (LOI) method, respectively. Then, the total belowground carbon sequestration was estimated. There was a depth related distribution of organic carbon in soil with the highest concentrations measured between 20 and 60cm depth. Accumulated carbon up to depth of 100cm in soil and roots of the planted K. obovata were 146.78±3.87Mg OC ha−1 and 12.67±0.14Mg OC ha−1, respectively. The value was 87.59±1.08Mg OC ha−1 for the adjacent bare land. Consequently, the mean carbon burial rate for this system was approximately 6.94Mg OC ha−1yr−1, which is higher than most of the mangroves and may be related to a low export of the net primary productivity or most likely to a high sedimentation rate. These results were compared with previously published results on carbon stocks in younger planted forests of the same species in the same region, a positive and linear relationship was determined between the age of the planted stand and the belowground carbon stocks.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"191-199","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Carbonstocks","Viet Nam","Soil","Carbon burial rates","Planted mangroves"]},{"key":"IC2SPMCD","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Adnani","lastName":"Navid"},{"firstName":"Rajski","lastName":" Scott R."},{"firstName":"Bugni","lastName":" Tim S."}],"title":"Symbiosis-inspired approaches to antibiotic discovery","publication_title":"Natural Product Reports","issn":"0265-0568","doi":"10.1039/c7np00009j","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265056822007279","abstract_note":"Covering: 2010 up to 2017 Life on Earth is characterized by a remarkable abundance of symbiotic and highly refined relationships among life forms. Defined as any kind of close, long-term association between two organisms, symbioses can be mutualistic, commensalistic or parasitic. Historically speaking, selective pressures have shaped symbioses in which one organism (typically a bacterium or fungus) generates bioactive small molecules that impact the host (and possibly other symbionts); the symbiosis is driven fundamentally by the genetic machineries available to the small molecule producer. The human microbiome is now integral to the most recent chapter in animal–microbe symbiosis studies and plant–microbe symbioses have significantly advanced our understanding of natural products biosynthesis; this also is the case for studies of fungal–microbe symbioses. However, much less is known about microbe–microbe systems involving interspecies interactions. Microbe-derived small molecules (i.e. antibiotics and quorum sensing molecules, etc.) have been shown to regulate transcription in microbes within the same environmental niche, suggesting interspecies interactions whereas, intraspecies interactions, such as those that exploit autoinducing small molecules, also modulate gene expression based on environmental cues. We, and others, contend that symbioses provide almost unlimited opportunities for the discovery of new bioactive compounds whose activities and applications have been evolutionarily optimized. Particularly intriguing is the possibility that environmental effectors can guide laboratory expression of secondary metabolites from “orphan”, or silent, biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Notably, many of the studies summarized here result from advances in “omics” technologies and highlight how symbioses have given rise to new anti-bacterial and antifungal natural products now being discovered.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"784-814","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"QITVMY7T","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Peterson","lastName":"A.

Sturnira parvidens inhabits lowland tropical areas from Mexico to Central America. The elevation of this taxon to species level was recent, and discrepancies with respect to its geographic limits and phylogenetic position continue to exist. In order to identify genetic and ecological processes likely involved in the diversification and current distribution of S. parvidens, we evaluated relationships, researched phylogeographic and demographic history, and tested the divergence/conservatism of the climatic niche of this bat. We used data from mitochondrial loci (cytochrome b and the hypervariable D-loop region I) and the nuclear recombination activating gene 1, in 173 samples of S. parvidens and 77 samples of related species. We performed Bayesian analyses to infer phylogenetic relationships and analyzed phylogeographic structure, genetic diversity, divergence times and historical demography. Sturnira bakeri is the sister group of S. parvidens, and inhabits Western Ecuador. The two species diverged c. 1.84Ma, and their distributions are disjunct and separated by Sturnira luisi. Within S. parvidens there are two haplogroups with nearly allopatric distributions that are limited to the Sierra Madre del Sur, on the Mexican Pacific Slope. The divergence time between haplogroups was c. 0.423Ma and we detected signals of demographic expansion. We also analyzed 526 occurrence data of S. parvidens to test for changes in environmental niche of this species. We detected signals of divergence of climatic niche, mainly in temperature and seasonality variables. Likely, both genetic and ecological processes have shaped the evolutionary history of S. parvidens. Despite many climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene, only the most intense oscillations had an impact on these bats. In addition, ecological differentiation prevents admixture of genetic lineages that are in contact and lack apparent geographical barriers at the southern Sierra Madre del Sur. We concluded that speciation in Sturnira was promoted by this taxon’s ability to colonize new geographical and environmental spaces and form genetically structured groups when populations become isolated.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"334-345","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Phylogeography","Climatic niche divergence","Frugivorous Neotropical bat"]},{"key":"6XCMIHA2","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"EkoeA Akata","lastName":" Aloys Martial"},{"firstName":"Njomo","lastName":" Donatien"},{"firstName":"Agrawal","lastName":" Basant"}],"title":"Assessment of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) for sustainable energy performance in tropical regions of Cameroon","publication_title":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","issn":"1364-0321","doi":"10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.155","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117307992","abstract_note":"Cameroon produces 1292MW of electricity out of which 57% is through hydraulic resources and the remaining 43% through fossil fuels resources.

The main objectives of this study were to gain insight into the seasonal variations in leaf area index (LAI) and root biomass growth, and to improve the accuracy of carbon sequestration estimates in early successional tropical secondary forests following shifting cultivation. Secondary vegetation of three different ages (1year, 6years and 10years after shifting cultivation) were monitored monthly with a LI-COR Plant Canopy Analyzer, and root growth was seasonally measured down to a depth of 400cm using ingrowth bags. The youngest secondary forests showed strong LAI seasonality, and the seasonality in LAI decreased in the oldest forest. The roots grew throughout the year even though the growth rates were higher during the dry season, which supported a dense biomass of leaves over the year. This study clearly indicates that information on deep rooting and seasonality of leaf area in secondary tropical forests is essential for understanding ecosystem ecophysiology, as well as community ecology and biogeochemical cycles.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"1-11","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Leafarea index","Fine-root production","Leaf biomass","Root ingrowth technique","Seasonality"]},{"key":"6ZCC7FQC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Cuca","lastName":"Branka"},{"firstName":"Hadjimitsis","lastName":" Diofantos G."}],"title":"Space technology meets policy: An overview of Earth Observation sensors for monitoring of cultural landscapes within policy framework for Cultural Heritage","publication_title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","issn":"2352-409X","doi":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.05.001","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17303218","abstract_note":"A wide range of satellite sensors that provide potentially useful imagery for digital documentation, mapping and monitoring of archaeological sites and cultural landscapes.

The run-of-river scheme had better environmental performance than the dam scheme. Very high emissions were found, being 547 Kg CO2-eq/MWh for dam scheme, which most of those emissions were originated in the reservoir, while the run-of-river scheme only score 2.6 Kg CO2-eq/MWh. However, comparing with fossil fuel power plants, hydropower dam case still has lower emissions in its entire life cycle. The paper remark that the majority of LCA studies which focus on dam hydropower scheme only consider the emissions of the construction, putting aside the loss of the ecosystem and the emissions caused by the impoundment.

Changes in the associated water mass formation might impact the deep ocean's capacity to take up anthropogenic CO2 while a warming of the deep ocean significantly contributes to global sea level rise. Here we compile historic and recent shipboard measurements of hydrography and velocity to provide a comprehensive view of water mass distribution, pathways, along-path transformation and long-term temperature changes of NADW and AABW in the western South and Equatorial Atlantic. We confirm previous results which show that the northwest corner of the Brazil Basin represents a splitting point for the southward/northward flow of NADW/AABW. The available measurements sample water mass transformation along the two major routes for deep and bottom waters in the tropical to South Atlantic – along the deep western boundary and eastward, parallel to the equator - as well as the hot-spots of extensive mixing. We find lower NADW and lighter AABW to form a highly interactive transition layer in the northern Brazil Basin. The AABW north of 5°S is relatively homogeneous with only lighter AABW being able to pass through the Equatorial Channel (EQCH) into the North Atlantic. Spanning a period of 26 years, our data also allow an estimation of long-term temperature trends in abyssal waters. We find a warming of 2.5±0.7∙10−3°Cyr−1 of the waters in the northern Brazil Basin at temperatures colder than 0.6°C throughout the period 1989–2014 and can relate this warming to a thinning of the dense AABW layer. Whereas isopycnal heave is the dominant effect which defines the vertical distribution of temperature trends on isobars, we also find temperature changes on isopycnals in the lower NADW and AABW layers. There temperatures on isopycnals exhibit decadal variations with warming in the 1990s and cooling in the 2000s - the contributions to the trends on isobars range from about 50% in the lighter AABW layers in the EQCH up to a maximum of 80% in the transition layer the lower NADW and lighter AABW form in the northern Brazil Basin.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"103-125","language":"en","automatic_tags":["AABWwarming","Abyssal circulation","Antarctic Bottom Water","North Atlantic Deep Water","Northern Brazil Basin"]},{"key":"WHNQSBB4","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Andriosopoulos","lastName":"Kostas"},{"firstName":"Silvestre","lastName":" Stephan"}],"title":"French energy policy: A gradual transition","publication_title":"Energy Policy","issn":"0301-4215","doi":"10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.015","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517302380","abstract_note":"Over the past decade, France has gradually adapted its energy policy to bring it into line with its international environmental commitments.

However, mangroves are disappearing worldwide because of demographic increases. In addition to the loss of CO2 fixation, mangrove clearing can strongly affect soil characteristics and C storage. The objectives of the present study were to quantify the evolution of soil quality, carbon stocks and carbon fluxes after mangrove clearing. Sediment cores to assess physico-chemical properties were collected and in situ CO2 fluxes were measured at the soil-air interface in a mangrove of Northern Vietnam. We compared a Kandelia candel mangrove forest with a nearby zone that had been cleared two years before the study. Significant decrease of clay content and an increase in bulk density for the upper 35cm in the cleared zone were observed. Soil organic carbon (OC) content in the upper 35cm decreased by >65% two years after clearing. The quantity and the quality of the carbon changed, with lower carbon to nitrogen ratios, indicating a more decomposed OM, a higher content of dissolved organic carbon, and a higher content of inorganic carbon (three times higher). This highlights the efficiency of mineralization processes following clearing. Due to the rapid decrease in the soil carbon content, CO2 fluxes at sediment interface were >50% lower in the cleared zone. Taking into account carbonate precipitation after OC mineralization, the mangrove soil lost ~10MgOCha−1yr−1 mostly as CO2 to the atmosphere and possibly as dissolved forms towards adjacent ecosystems. The impacts on the carbon cycle of mangrove clearing as shown by the switch from a C sink to a C source highlight the importance of maintaining these ecosystems, particularly in a context of climate change.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"654-663","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Carbonstocks","South East Asia","Afforested mangrove","Sediment properties","Soil CO fluxes","Xuan Thuy National Park"]},{"key":"LJGEEAG5","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Fillol","lastName":"Erwann"},{"firstName":"Albarelo","lastName":" Tommy"},{"firstName":"Primerose","lastName":" Antoine"},{"firstName":"Wald","lastName":" Lucien"},{"firstName":"Linguet","lastName":" Laurent"}],"title":"Spatiotemporal indicators of solar energy potential in the Guiana Shield using GOES images","publication_title":"Renewable Energy","issn":"0960-1481","doi":"10.1016/j.renene.2017.03.081","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148117302720","abstract_note":"The purpose of this article is to evaluate the potential for solar energy in the Guiana Shield and propose indicators to encourage the exploitation of solar energy systems in this area. For this, we use the Heliosat-2 optimized method to process images from the geostationary meteorological satellite GOES acquired in the period from April 2010 to July 2015. We calculated the average daily global horizontal irradiation (GHI) and direct normal irradiation (DNI) throughout the study period. The results obtained allowed us to establish four indicators: maps of production potential, the inter-day variability of DNI and GHI, maps of solar panel orientation related to maximum solar potential, and maps of areas where the solar resource is under the exploitable potential threshold. We also added an additional indicator, the suitability of areas for solar system installation depending on the ground slope. Our study shows that the average value of production potential for the entire Guiana Shield is approximately 1780 kWh.kWc−1.year−1 for GHI and 2040 kWh.kWc−1.year−1 for DNI. Comparisons with pyranometer measurements indicate an error relative bias of less than 2% and a relative RMSE of less than 21% for hourly estimates of GHI. Although the Guiana Shield region is covered by many clouds, few areas show insufficient solar potential for the exploitation of GHI and DNI, but the hilly nature of the area limits possible locations of very large power plants and instead favors more medium-sized plants. This is the first study that offers exploitability indicators for solar resources in the Guiana Shield. In conclusion, the established indicators provide a new perspective on the solar potential in the Guiana Shield and are expected to promote the development of new solar energy operating systems.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"11-25","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Indicators","Renewable energy","Guiana shield","Heliosat-2","Solar irradiation","Suitability areas"]},{"key":"VKZKQRJD","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2018","author":[{"firstName":"Prip","lastName":"Christian"}],"title":"The Convention on Biological Diversity as a legal framework for safeguarding ecosystem services","publication_title":"Ecosystem Services","issn":"2212-0416","doi":"10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.02.015","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041617301043","abstract_note":"Biodiversity underpins ecosystem services. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has adopted an ecosystem services approach as a framework for biodiversity management at the national level. Protection of ecosystem services requires far more than traditional nature conservation measures like the designation and management of protected areas. The economic sectors that affect biodiversity and ecosystem services must be involved, to address not merely the symptoms but the root causes of the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Achieving coherence in policies and actions across economic sectors and the changes involved in values, decision-making and practices, requires legal approaches to ensure buy-in and accountability. Ideally, such approaches should be included in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), the key instrument for translating the CBD into national action. A review of 20 revised NBSAPs shows that such measures have been introduced only to a very limited extent with many countries still in the earliest stages of preparing measures to protect ecosystem services. Thus, there is a need for further research and practical guidance regarding legal approaches to ecosystem services.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"199-204","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Ecosystemservices","Biodiversity","Ecosystems","Sustainable development","Millennium Ecosystem Assessment","The Convention on Biological Diversity"]},{"key":"8Z96WAI7","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Boucher","lastName":"A."},{"firstName":"Herrmann","lastName":" J.

The latter accounts for a significant proportion of presumably infectious encephalitis cases without any established etiological diagnosis; as shown from a prospective cohort study where 21% of cases were due to an immune cause. Several infectious agents are frequently reported in all studies: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most frequent pathogen in 65% of studies, followed by Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in several studies. Enteroviruses are also reported; being the most frequent viruses in two studies, and the 2nd or 3rd viruses in five other studies. There are important regional differences, especially in case of vector-borne transmission: Asia and the Japanese encephalitis virus, Eastern and Northern Europe/Eastern Russia and the tick-borne encephalitis virus, Northern America and Flavivirus or Alphavirus. Bacteria can also be incriminated: Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes are the most frequent, after HSV and VZV, in a French prospective study. The epidemiology of encephalitis is constantly evolving. Epidemiological data may indicate the emergence and/or dissemination of new causative agents. The dissemination and emergence of causative agents are fostered by environmental, social, and economical changes, but prevention programs (vaccination, vector controls) help reduce the incidence of other infectious diseases and associated encephalitis (e.g., measles).

We show that the inclusion of these features can have a non-trivial effect on the simulated response of hydropower production to changes in climate. Simulation results highlight substantial uncertainty in the direction of change in globally aggregated hydropower production (~−5 to +5% change in mean global production by the 2080s under a high emissions scenario, depending on GCM). Several clearly impacted hotspots are identified, the most prominent of which encompasses the Mediterranean countries in southern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. In this region, hydropower production is projected to be reduced by approximately 40% on average by the end of the century under a high emissions scenario. After accounting for each country's dependence on hydropower for meeting its current electricity demands, the Balkans countries emerge as the most vulnerable (~5–20% loss in total national electricity generation depending on country).

At the scale of the whole territory the distribution of species and species traits was mostly driven by a spatially-structured gradient embracing regional climate (annual rainfall), forest matrix (canopy openness), and inselberg features (altitude, shape, habitats, summit forest, degree of epiphytism, fire events). Biogeographic, environmental and past historical factors contribute to explain the variation observed at coarse scale and two groups of inselbergs are identified. A first group occupies the southern peneplain in a semi-open forest matrix and exhibits a higher representation of suffrutescent species and climbers, a lower representation of upright shrubs, a lower degree of Guiana Shield endemism, and a higher incidence of human use and autochory.

Myrtaceae is one of the most diverse Neotropical groups and it therefore a good proxy of plant diversity in the region. However, biogeographic studies on Neotropical Myrtaceae are still very limited. Myrcia s.l. is an informal group comprising three accepted genera (Calyptranthes, Marlierea and Myrcia) making up the second largest Neotropical group of Myrtaceae, totalling about 700 species distributed in nine subgroups. Exclusively Neotropical, the group occurs along the whole of the Neotropics with diversity centres in the Caribbean, the Guiana Highlands and the central-eastern Brazil. This study aims to identify the time and place of divergence of Myrcia s.l. lineages, to examine the correlation in light of geological and climatic events in the Neotropics, and to explore relationships among Neotropical biogeographic areas. A dated phylogenetic hypothesis was produced using BEAST and calibrated by placing Paleomyrtinaea princetonensis (56Ma) at the root of the tree; biogeographic analysis used the DEC model with dispersal probabilities between areas based on distance and floristic affinities. Myrcia s.l. originated in the Montane Atlantic Forest between the end of Eocene and early Miocene and this region acted as a secondary cradle for several lineages during the evolution of this group. The Caribbean region was important in the diversification of the Calyptranthes clade while the Guayana shield appears as ancestral area for an older subgroup of Myrcia s.l. The Amazon Forest has relatively low diversity of Myrcia s.l. species but appears to have been important in the initial biogeographic history of old lineages. Lowland Atlantic Forest has high species diversity but species rich lineages did not originate in the area. Diversification of most subgroups of Myrcia s.l. occurred throughout the Miocene, as reported for other Neotropical taxa. During the Miocene, geological events may have influenced the evolution of the Caribbean and Amazon forest lineages, but other regions were geological stable and climate changes were the most likely drivers of diversification. The evolution of many lineages in montane areas suggests that Myrcia s.l. may be particularly adapted to such environments.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"34-48","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Caribbean","Guiana Shield","Amazon Forest, Atlantic Forest","Plant diversity"]},{"key":"CI5Z599K","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Walsh","lastName":"J.

We conclude that all of these EIAs fall short of properly assessing the expected impact of infrastructure development in situ, and that their results had little or no effect on policy decisions. To improve the reliability and usefulness of EIAs in biologically diverse ecosystems, we suggest three relatively fast and cost-effective complementary approaches for assessing biodiversity: remote sensing, reflectance spectroscopy, and DNA meta-barcoding. We discuss how these emerging cutting-edge techniques can help in identifying environmental threats and the consequences of different activities in Amazonia.

Major sources of desert dust include the Sahara, the Middle East, central and eastern Asia, and parts of Australia, but dust-raising occurs all across the global drylands and, on occasion, beyond. Dust storms occur throughout the year and they vary in frequency and intensity over a number of timescales. Long-range transport of desert dust typically takes place along seasonal transport paths. Desert dust hazards are here reviewed according to the three phases of the wind erosion system: where dust is entrained, during the transport phase, and on deposition. This paper presents a synthesis of these hazards. It draws on empirical examples in physical geography, medical geology and geomorphology to discuss case studies from all over the world and in various fields. These include accelerated soil erosion in agricultural zones – where dust storms represent a severe form of accelerated soil erosion – the health effects of air pollution caused by desert aerosols via their physical, chemical and biological properties, transport accidents caused by poor visibility during desert dust events, and impacts on electricity generation and distribution. Given the importance of desert dust as a hazard to human societies, it is surprising to note that there have been relatively few attempts to assess their impact in economic terms. Existing studies in this regard are also reviewed, but the wide range of impacts discussed in this paper indicates that desert dust storms deserve more attention in this respect.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"53-63","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Drylands","Climate hazards","Desert dust","Mineral aerosols","Particulate matter","Wind erosion"]},{"key":"G5Y95TTY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Schlund","lastName":"Michael"},{"firstName":"Scipal","lastName":" Klaus"},{"firstName":"Davidson","lastName":" Malcolm W.

BIOMASS will provide for the first time global forest aboveground biomass estimates based on P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. This paper addresses an often overlooked element of the data processing chain required to ensure reliable and accurate forest biomass estimates: accurate identification of forest areas ahead of the inversion of radar data into forest biomass estimates. The use of the P-band data from BIOMASS itself for the classification into forest and non-forest land cover types is assessed in this paper. For airborne data in tropical, hemi-boreal and boreal forests we demonstrate that classification accuracies from 90 up to 97% can be achieved using radar backscatter and phase information. However, spaceborne data will have a lower resolution and higher noise level compared to airborne data and a higher probability of mixed pixels containing multiple land cover types. Therefore, airborne data was reduced to 50m, 100m and 200m resolution. The analysis revealed that about 50–60% of the area within the resolution level must be covered by forest to classify a pixel with higher probability as forest compared to non-forest. This results in forest omission and commission leading to similar forest area estimation over all resolutions. However, the forest omission resulted in a biased underestimated biomass, which was not equaled by the forest commission. The results underline the necessity of a highly accurate pre-classification of SAR data for an accurate unbiased aboveground biomass estimation.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:17:30","pages":"65-76","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Abovegroundbiomass","Forestry","BIOMASS","Classification","P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]},{"key":"DYZ7AVVJ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"López","lastName":"Marlén"},{"firstName":"Rubio","lastName":" Ramón"},{"firstName":"Martín","lastName":" Santiago"},{"firstName":"Ben Croxford"}],"title":"How plants inspire façades.

Jaguars (Panthera onca) are the focus of a range-wide conservation strategy extending from Mexico to Argentina that consists of jaguar conservation units (JCUs) and modeled corridors. Recent deforestation is a major threat to jaguar populations, but forest loss has not been systematically assessed across the entire jaguar network. In this study, we quantified the amount and rate of deforestation in JCUs and corridors between 2000 and 2012. JCUs lost 37,780km2 forest (0.93%) at an increasing rate of 149.2km2yr−2, corridors lost 45,979km2 (4.43%) at a decreasing rate of 40.1km2yr−2, and levels of forest fragmentation increased in corridors. Protected sections of JCUs and corridors lost less forest than unprotected sections, suggesting efforts to increase protected status of jaguar conservation areas are warranted. Higher deforestation in corridors indicates difficulties in maintaining connectivity of jaguar populations, and suggests the need for increased engagement with communities within corridor landscapes. Assessment of spatial variability of anthropogenic threats within the jaguar network may improve jaguar conservation by informing network prioritization and function.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"8-16","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Connectivity","Conservation planning","Deforestation","Fragmentation","Protected areas"]},{"key":"ICRSHB4W","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"VelascoHerrera","lastName":" Graciela"}],"title":"Mexican forest fires and their decadal variations","publication_title":"Advances in Space Research","issn":"0273-1177","doi":"10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.030","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117716304835","abstract_note":"A high forest fire season of two to three years is regularly observed each decade in Mexican forests.

The association of tree cover gains with tree cover losses and humid climates suggests a second dynamic, a churning, treadmill-like production of wood products from lands subjected to recurring harvests of wood products followed by tree cover gains in the recently harvested areas. The forest transition dynamic suggests that many smallholders would allow tree cover to expand on their lands if payments for environmental services were available.

Tertiary environments of kaolinization: (1) burial diagenesis, (2) very-low grade regional dynamo metamorphism, (3) contact metamorphism. The above tripartite subdivision of kaolin has been established so as to be in accordance with other lithologies which formed through magmatic, sedimentary, and metamorphic processes and to link the present classification scheme directly with the “Chessboard classification scheme of mineral deposits” (Dill, 2010b). While in many classification schemes of mineral deposits kaolin and its minerals were only considered as an “ore” in the category non-metallic deposits and industrial minerals, in the current review the barriers between economic geology and its neighboring disciplines like sedimentology, pedology, geomorphology, petrography and palaeoclimatology have been torn down and the kaolin looked at from different angles, as soil, rock and ore. Kaolin and kaolinitic clays are taken as the type-lithology of the near-surface continental environments. Together with bentonites, bentonitic clays and a varied spectrum of argillites they form part of a group of lithologies, encompassing besides bauxite, ferrites (ferricretes) and laterite, all of which developed close to the interface between atmosphere, pedosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. To accentuate the intimate relation between the various lithologies mentioned in the previous paragraph, a classification scheme has been designed. It makes use in part of pre-existing ternary plots to take also account of these interferences with the different geoscientific disciplines such as sedimentology or pedology. In addition to that, an overview of the various field and laboratory methods to identify and quantify kaolin/kaolinite-group minerals is given. The succeeding parameters, features and settings are crucial as to the kaolinization in the magmatic, sedimentary and metamorphic environments. Geodynamic setting The sites most favorable to develop large (economic) kaolin deposits are located along the passive continental margin and in epicontinental basins. Almost all of the kaolin deposits have to be attributed to the secondary deposits. Rate of uplift and weathering Cratonic crustal sections stable over a long period of time with little vertical displacement are crustal sections favorable for kaolin formation and preservation. During slow uplift, chemical weathering operative in the peneplained hinterland and on the sedimentary bodies in the foreland helped to decompose labile constituents from the parent material and enhance the quality and increase the thickness of the kaolin. Reducing the slope angle or the paleogradient, i.e., moving from the alluvial-colluvial fan system towards deltaic and swampy environments raises the likelihood of kaolin concentration of economic grade. The drainage pattern and hydrography The fluvial drainages system most proximal to the residual kaolin and most favorable for kaolin is the braided-stream drainage system. In the meandering-river system two different types “bar sand kaolin” and the “overbank kaolin deposits” occur. Kaolin accumulation may be tracked down to the coastal marine deposits under humid climatic conditions. Rivers are accountable for a steady supply of suspended load, the tidal processes is held most effective in concentrating the fine-grained raw material and wave action in combination with the transgression and regression of strandlines act as a seal and preserve the kaolin deposit. The tidal analogues developing under arid climatic conditions, also known as coastal sabkha, are of no relevance for kaolin concentration. The most well-balanced state between concentration and preservation of kaolin is achieved in the blind estuary under a mesotidal regime. Organic matter and the redox regime The organic matter has no effect on the formation of kaolin in the primary deposits. In the secondary kaolin deposits the mediating effect increases from the residual kaolin deposits towards the coastal marine deposits. It shows “local positive anomalies” in “wet systems”. Near the basin edge and the hinterland kaolin forms in the upper oxidized vadose zone and more basinward be it lacustrine or marine it prefers the lower reduced part, also called the phreatic zone, of the hydrosphere. Organic matter in metamorphosed black shales has not only a “buffering” effect on the kinematic processes but also a preserving or stimulating effect on kaolinite to form as long as the critical temperature between low- and very-low grade stage metamorphism is not crossed. The variation in the redox conditions is well represented by the valence state of iron in its minerals, e.g., siderite vs. goethite and by the REE. Among the chemical methods, REE anomalies (cerium) can assist in constraining the redox conditions. Temperature and pressure control Only in magmatic kaolin deposits a correlation between the type of kaolinite-group minerals and the temperature is evident. The temperature of formation has been demonstrated to have an influence on the crystallinity of kaolinite and as a “rule of thumbs” the following succession can be given provided a T-controlled kaolinization can be confirmed: Allophane+imogolite⇒halloysite⇒kaolinite⇒dickite⇒nacrite. Frequently only part of the sequence is realized in nature. To distinguish hypogene from supergene kaolin, O and H isotopes have proved to be a successful tool, in that these isotopes assist to constrain the temperature of kaolinization. In the course of deep-burial diagenesis, kaolinite is not indicative of a mineralogical depth-response reaction but rather a marker for breaks or hiatuses during basin subsidence. As the intraformational solutions got spoiled by the immigration of fluids from whatever per ascensum and per descensum processes the resultant disequilibrium within the reservoir rocks has to be offset in case of a drop in pH by the formation of kaolinite-group minerals. Lithostatic pressure has been demonstrated to have no effect on kaolinization. Shearing stress is detrimental to the formation and preservation of kaolinite-group minerals. Structure bound kaolin has always been found to be post-kinematic and no shear zone has been mapped where kaolin is pre- or synkinematic. The presence of kaolinite in zones of structural disturbances or elevated stress and strain is due to infiltrations of meteoric and low-salinity waters. Chemical composition of fluids The chemical composition, as far as the content of alkaline earth, alkaline elements and the pH value are concerned, plays a significant role in the course of kaolinization. These fluids are accountable for the transformation parent rock ⇒ kaolin ⇔ bauxite/ferricretes/laterites (with the option of resilicification) and in pedological terms for the “cold kaolin” (humid mid-latitude climatic zone) and “warm kaolin” (humid tropical climatic zone). Ferralsols, plinthosols, nitisols, podzols (also present under these tropical climatic regime), andosols and vertisol are typical of the climatic zones near the equator. These fluids do not only facilitate the formation of kaolinite but also enhance the quality of kaolin by depleting the argillaceous saprolite from impurities such as Fe and Ti. As a result of pH changes the distribution of labile and intermediately stable heavy minerals negatively correlates to the clay mineral variation. In the proximal parts of the basin, where the amount of kaolin is high, the prevailing heavy minerals belong to the group of ultrastable minerals such as rutile, tourmaline, and zircon, whereas more basinward where the kaolinite contents decrease in a vadose system, apatite and labile ones become the most important heavy minerals. It provides a clear proof for an increase of the alkalinity of the basinal fluids more basinward. The opposite trend is observed in the phreatic zone as the redox-sensitive heavy minerals of the Fe-Ti system are considered. They show a positive trend along with kaolin from the basin edge to the basin center, particularly in terms of the valence state of Fe, which changes from the trivalent to the bivalent state. Parent material Kaolin can evolve on almost all lithologies. The likelihood increases with an increase in Al and Si, but even lithologies depleted in these elements such as carbonates form, in places, a good substrate to develop kaolin, provided enough time was given to the process of alteration and the climatic regime and geodynamic setting work hand in hand. The only lithology and environments which fail to bring about kaolin deposits are salt deposits and zones of extreme evaporation. The climatic and hydrological conditions are more crucial as to the formation of secondary kaolin deposits than the composition of the parent material. Kaolin is a non-metallic raw material which has taken a position covering the entire spectrum from high-place value commodities when used for ceramics (e.g. bricks, earthenware) to the high-unit-value commodities in use for the body of the finest chinaware or even pharmaceuticals. Due to its wide range of final applications, methods and geophysical techniques (PIMA) are currently enhanced to preselect high quality kaolin and get rid of ingredients detrimental to the (high) end product. Requirements of kaolin are discussed in this review as to its use for different final products. Attention has been paid to the formation of geogenic dioxin in sedimentary/secondary kaolin which is closely related to the environment. Kaolin is not only a raw material for one of the finest products, porcelain, but also a type mineral for a varied spectrum of environments of deposition characterized by a rather sharp upper limit of formation of 390±10°C at a pressure of 2000 bar. For all geoscientists dealing with processes below this physical-chemical boundary, the role of kaolin and its mineralogical constituents as marker cannot be overestimated.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"16-129","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Classification","Climate","Economic geology","Environment analysis","Field-laboratory methods","Kaolin","Magmatic/primary","Metamorphic/tertiary","Mineral","Ore","Rock","Sedimentary/secondary","Soil"]},{"key":"BPQCPPYZ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Sutton","lastName":"Paul C."},{"firstName":"Anderson","lastName":" Sharolyn J."},{"firstName":"Costanza","lastName":" Robert"},{"firstName":"Kubiszewski","lastName":" Ida"}],"title":"The ecological economics of land degradation: Impacts on ecosystem service values","publication_title":"Ecological Economics","issn":"0921-8009","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.06.016","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800915301725","abstract_note":"We use two datasets to characterize impacts on ecosystem services.

Results showed that plantation had significant effects on microbial respiration and the responses of microbial respiration to plantation from different soil layers and topographies were different: in 0–20 cm in uphill: GB>GBH>CK; in 20–40 cm in uphill: GBH>CK>GB; in 0–20 cm in downhill: GBH>CK>GB; in 20–40 cm in downhill: GB>CK>GBH. Furthermore, plantation also altered the relationships between MR and soil properties. In CK, microbial respiration was positively correlated with NH4+ and soil total N, and negatively correlated with soil moisture, pH, NO3−, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). In GB, microbial respiration under GB significantly negatively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In GBH, microbial respiration under GBH was positively correlated with NH4+, MBC, total soil carbon (TC), and total soil nitrogen (TN), and negatively correlated with soil moisture (SM), pH, NO3−, and DOC. The underlying mechanisms could be attributed to soil heterogeneity and the effects of plantation on soil properties.

A bioeconomic model was used to test management measures through scenarios that ran over eleven years to estimate the viability of the fishery according to biological and economic results. The most beneficial scenario was the combination of several management measures including a temporal closure of two months, the replacement of the 40mm diamond mesh codend with 40mm square mesh, the removal of both the biological recovery tax and of fuel subsidies, and an 83% reduction in fishing capacity. This results in an annual private profit higher by 9.3M TND (Tunisian Dinar) (6.9M USD) that of 2008, and an economic rent that was higher by 13.3M TND (9.9M USD) than by the end of the projected period.

While a large number of efforts have been made to extract coastline and detect coastline change with remotely sensed data, the temporal frequency and spatial resolution of coastline datasets obtained are generally not fine enough to reflect the detailed process of coastline retreat and/or advance, particularly in coastlines with subtle variability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a method to continuously monitor the dynamics of a muddy coastline with subtle variability in western Florida at annual and subpixel scales using time-series Landsat data (1984–2013). First, robust indicators were used to indicate the annual “average” location of the dynamic coastline. Due to the complexity of muddy-coast morphology, the annual average location is represented not by the coast “line”, but by the fractional inundated “area” of coastline pixels (pixels where the coastline is located), namely annually inundated area. Second, the annually inundated area of coastline pixels was estimated with a model proposed in this study, and the uncertainty was estimated with the Monte Carlo method. The retrievals were validated at 10 sites with aerial imagery, and the overall RMSE (root mean square error) is 11.48%. Third, the long-term trend for the time series of annually inundated area was derived with a statistical model. The results indicate that the muddy coast in western Florida continues to shrink with an average rate of 0.42±0.05km2/year during the three decades.

In many tropical forests most tree and shrub species require dispersal by animals for local persistence and for migration in response to environmental change. The most important errors to avoid in practical use of both dispersal syndromes (suites of fruit and seed characteristics that attract different dispersal agents) and network modules (groups of interacting dispersal agents and plants bearing fruits or seeds that they eat) are: (1) assuming that use of fruit resources by fruit-eating animals implies effective seed dispersal; (2) assuming that superficially similar fruits imply equally effective dispersal by similar animals, and (3) assuming that fruit resources at issue support animal populations. This essay explores strengths and weaknesses of uses of dispersal syndromes and disperser networks modules in conservation and restoration. Examples include some that are consistent with expectations from syndrome categorization and some that are not. An unappreciated weakness in using either dispersal syndromes or network modules is that contingent foraging by animals in highly disturbed habitats, now comprising 60%–70% of tropical land biomes, may not resemble foraging choices or consequences in protected closed forests, where most research on tropical seed dispersal is done. General prescriptions for the future include maintaining or creating habitat heterogeneity in largely deforested landscapes where remnant closed forests still exist, and active restoration in landscapes where little heterogeneity remains. In both cases, adaptations of multiple frame-work tree approaches have the best chance of preserving or enhancing populations of animal-dispersed trees and their seed vectors, and in opening migration paths in response to climate change.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"152-178","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biodiversity","Environmental change","Plant regeneration","Restoring dispersal processes","Seed dispersal"]},{"key":"4LSXTIRT","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Wong","lastName":"Samson Sai-Yin"},{"firstName":"Poon","lastName":" Rosana Wing-Shan"},{"firstName":"Wong","lastName":" Sally Cheuk-Ying"}],"title":"Zika virus infection—the next wave after dengue?","publication_title":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","issn":"0929-6646","doi":"10.1016/j.jfma.2016.02.002","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664616000772","abstract_note":"Zika virus was initially discovered in east Africa about 70 years ago and remained a neglected arboviral disease in Africa and Southeast Asia.

Here, uncertainty estimates are derived using the comparison on a 12th-degree grid of coincident daily records of the remote-sensing reflectance RRS obtained with the same processing chain from three satellite missions, MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS. The approach is spatially resolved and produces σ, the part of the RRS uncertainty budget associated with random effects. The global average of σ decreases with wavelength from approximately 0.7–0.910−3sr−1 at 412nm to 0.05–0.110−3sr−1 at the red band, with uncertainties on σ evaluated as 20–30% between 412 and 555nm, and 30–40% at 670nm. The distribution of σ shows a restricted spatial variability and small variations with season, which makes the multi-annual global distribution of σ an estimate applicable to all retrievals of the considered missions. The comparison of σ with other uncertainty estimates derived from field data or with the support of algorithms provides a consistent picture. When translated in relative terms, and assuming a relatively low bias, the distribution of σ suggests that the objective of a 5% uncertainty is fulfilled between 412 and 490nm for oligotrophic waters (chlorophyll-a concentration below 0.1mgm−3). This study also provides comparison statistics. Spectrally, the mean absolute relative difference between RRS from different missions shows a characteristic U-shape with both ends at blue and red wavelengths inversely related to the amplitude of RRS. On average and for the considered data sets, SeaWiFS RRS tend to be slightly higher than MODIS RRS, which in turn appear higher than MERIS RRS. Biases between mission-specific RRS may exhibit a seasonal dependence, particularly in the subtropical belt.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"107-124","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Oceancolor","Remote sensing reflectance","Uncertainty"]},{"key":"3V6RXQCU","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Curtarelli","lastName":"Marcelo Pedroso"},{"firstName":"Ogashawara","lastName":" Igor"},{"firstName":"de Araújo","lastName":" Carlos Alberto Sampaio"},{"firstName":"Lorenzzetti","lastName":" João Antônio"},{"firstName":"Leão","lastName":" Joaquim Antônio Dionísio"},{"firstName":"Alcântara","lastName":" Enner"},{"firstName":"Stech","lastName":" José Luiz"}],"title":"Carbon dioxide emissions from Tucuruí reservoir (Amazon biome): New findings based on three-dimensional ecological model simulations","publication_title":"Science of The Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.001","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716302121","abstract_note":"We used a three-dimensional model to assess the dynamics of diffusive carbon dioxide flux (FCO2) from a hydroelectric reservoir located at Amazon rainforest. Our results showed that for the studied periods (2013 summer/wet and winter/dry seasons) the surface averaged FCO2 presented similar behaviors, with regular emissions peaks. The mean daily surface averaged FCO2 showed no significant difference between the seasons (p>0.01), with values around −1338mgCm−2day−1 (summer/wet) and −1395mgCm−2day−1 (winter/dry). At diel scale, the FCO2 was large during the night and morning and low during the afternoon in both seasons. Regarding its spatial distribution, the FCO2 showed to be more heterogeneous during the summer/wet than during the winter/dry season. The highest FCO2 were observed at transition zone (−300mgCm−2h−1) during summer and at littoral zone (−55mgCm−2h−1) during the winter. The total CO2 emitted by the reservoir along 2013year was estimated to be 1.1TgCyear−1. By extrapolating our results we found that the total carbon emitted by all Amazonian reservoirs can be around 7TgCyear−1, which is 22% lower than the previous published estimate. This significant difference should not be neglected in the carbon inventories since the carbon emission is a key factor when comparing the environmental impacts of different sources of electricity generation and can influences decision makers in the selection of the more appropriate source of electricity and, in case of hydroelectricity, the geographical position of the reservoirs.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"676-694","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Amazonbiome","Carbon dioxide","Greenhouse gases emission","Hydroelectric reservoirs","Numerical modeling"]},{"key":"AJS7CG83","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Yanow","lastName":"Stephanie K."},{"firstName":"Gavina","lastName":" Kenneth"},{"firstName":"Gnidehou","lastName":" Sedami"},{"firstName":"Maestre","lastName":" Amanda"}],"title":"Impact of Malaria in Pregnancy as Latin America Approaches Elimination","publication_title":"Trends in Parasitology","issn":"1471-4922","doi":"10.1016/j.pt.2016.01.008","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471492216000222","abstract_note":"In Latin America, four million pregnancies are at risk of malaria annually, but malaria in pregnancy is largely overlooked.

Bornean tropical rainforests have particularly higher aboveground biomass because of high stand densities of tall emergent trees, and no regular seasonal dry period. These properties may reflect specific Rwood variation and higher annual Rwood at the ecosystem scale (annual-Rwood) in Borneo. Hence, in this study, we investigated factors that affect inter-individual variation in chamber-based Rwood on stem surfaces at breast height (chamber-Rwood) and estimated Rwood at the ecosystem scale (ecosystem-Rwood) in a Bornean tropical rainforest. Subsequently, we examined temporal variation in ecosystem-Rwood with environmental factors, estimated annual-Rwood, and then evaluated the effects of large trees on ecosystem-Rwood. Stem growth rates were the most significant predictor of inter-individual variation in chamber-Rwood during all five measurement periods between 2012 and 2014. Accordingly, stem growth rates allowed accurate estimates of ecosystem-Rwood, although chamber-Rwood varied with diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree species in some measurement campaigns. Ecosystem-Rwood decreased with soil moisture. Considering the inter-individual and temporal variation, annual-Rwood was estimated at 7.06±2.09 MgC ha−1year−1. This value was comparable to those determined in Neotropical forests, even though aboveground biomass in the present study site was approximately twice of those in Neotropical sites. Large trees with DBH >70cm comprised 38% of aboveground biomass but accounted for only 23% of ecosystem-Rwood because of the small portion of woody tissue surface area of the large trees. These data indicate that the stand density of large trees can considerably affect aboveground biomass but exert less influence on variation in ecosystem-Rwood among various forests.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"190-199","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Ecosystemscale","Emergent trees","Inter-individual variation","Scaling","Stem CO efflux"]},{"key":"BENWUDYC","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Escobedo-Morales","lastName":"Luis A."},{"firstName":"Mandujano","lastName":" Salvador"},{"firstName":"Eguiarte","lastName":" Luis E."},{"firstName":"Rodríguez-Rodríguez","lastName":" Marco A."},{"firstName":"Maldonado","lastName":" Jesús E."}],"title":"First phylogenetic analysis of Mesoamerican brocket deer Mazama pandora and Mazama temama (Cetartiodactyla: Cervidae) based on mitochondrial sequences: Implications for Neotropical deer evolution","publication_title":"Mammalian Biology","issn":"1616-5047","doi":"10.1016/j.mambio.2016.02.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1616504716300088","abstract_note":"Several recent studies have tried to unravel the complex evolutionary history of Neotropical cervids. However, the two Mesoamerican brocket deer Mazama pandora and M. temama have not been included in these studies and their relationship to other Neotropical cervids remains unclear. Here, we present analyses that included concatenated sequences from the mitochondrial genes ND2, Cytb, and tRNA-Pro-Control region. Our results suggest that both Mesoamerican brocket deer fall within the “red” clade, more closely related to genus Odocoileus and red brocket deer species, such as South American Mazama americana, M. bororo, M. nana, and M. rufina. We estimated that M. temama diverged from other red brocket deer ca. two MYA. Two hypothesis emerge regarding the relationship of the Yucatan brocket deer M. pandora with respect to the other Neotropical deer. The first one, based on analyses of concatenated sequences from all three genes, implies an early split from a larger clade that includes Odocoileus and other red Mazama species, with an estimated divergence time dating back to 2.7 MYA. This would suggest isolation on the Yucatan peninsula, limiting the crossing of this species into South America. The second one, based only on Cytb, places M. pandora more closely related to Odocoileus and with an estimated divergence time of ca. 1.9 MYA. This would suggest that the humid tropical forests of Mexico and Central America could have been the most likely place of origin of members of the red brocket deer clade. Deer colonization into South America occurred after the complete formation of the Panamanian land bridge in the late Pliocene, more than one ancestor of the gray brocket deer clade crossed into South America, as well as a red brocket deer ancestor and Odocoileus dispersed southward. A posterior event probably occurred when divergent ancestors of M. temama and M. pandora respectively moved northward after the split with South American red brocket deer. Our results add to the growing body of evidence calling for an extensive taxonomic revision of this group, and we concur with previous recommendations that the generic taxonomic designation of Mazama should be applied not only to the red brocket deer but also to all of the species currently recognized under the genus Odocoileus.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"303-313","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Mesoamerica","mtDNA","Neotropical deer evolution"]},{"key":"V6HZB6SW","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Larroque","lastName":"O.

Brazil, due to its large size and wide range of environmental challenges, presents numerous hazards to children's health. The aim of this study was to systematically review the scientific literature that describes children's exposures to environmental pollutants in Brazil and their effects on Brazilian children's health. A systematic review of the scientific literature was performed without language restrictions and time of publication (years). The literature search was conducted in the following key resources: PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and Web of Science with the MeSH Terms: Environmental exposure AND Brazil (filters: Human, Child [birth to 18 years] and Affiliation Author). The Virtual Health Library was also employed to access the databases Scielo and Lilacs. The search strategy was [DeCS Terms]: Child OR adolescent AND Environmental exposure AND Brazil. Health effects in children associated with exposure to environmental pollutants in Brazil were reported in 74 studies, during the period between 1995 and 2015. The most frequently cited effect was hospital admission for respiratory causes including wheezing, asthma, and pneumonia among children living in areas with high concentrations of air pollutants. A broad spectrum of other health effects possibly linked to pollutants also was found such as prematurity, low birth weight, congenital abnormality (cryptorchidism, hypospadia, micropenis), poor performance in tests of psychomotor and mental development, and behavioral problems. Exposure to pesticides in utero and postnatally was associated with a high risk for leukemia in children <2 years old.

However, the relationship between the start date of a growing (or greening) season (SGS) when derived from different vegetation indices (VI's), and the starting day of carbon uptake is not well elucidated. Additionally, the validation of existing phenology data with in-situ measurements is largely missing. We have investigated the possibility to use different VI's to predict the starting day of the growing season for 28 FLUXNET sites as well as MODIS data. This analysis included main plant functional types (PFT's). Of all VI's taken into account in this paper, the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) shows the highest correlation coefficient for the relationship between the starting day of the growing season as observed with MODIS and in-situ observations. However, MODIS observations elicit a 20–21days earlier SGS date compared to in-situ observations. The prediction for the NEE start of the growing season diverges when using different VI's, and seems to depend on the amplitude for carbon and VI and on PFT.

In this paper, we have provided the first estimate of the return on investment for nine large protected areas that compose the core of the ecological infrastructure of the State of Amapá, which is located in a new forest frontier in Brazilian Amazonia. These nine protected areas will require US $147.2million over five years in order to be established and then US $32.7million in annual recurrent costs. If implemented, these nine protected areas have the potential to contribute at least US $362.4million per year in benefits (timber, non-timber forest products, nature-based tourism, fisheries, and carbon) to the local economy. The return on investment (ROI) of these protected areas will be 1.6% during the first five years and 10% thereafter; however, ROI could reach 45.8% or more if option and non-use values are also included as benefits. Although the costs of establishing the protected area system in Amapá are higher (US $3.2–3.5ha−1y−1) than the costs reported in other tropical forest regions (US $0.2–0.4ha−1y−1), the investments required are within the reach of both state and national governments.

However, this class of model requires many physiological parameters that are difficult to measure for species not easily kept in captivity. It is also difficult to estimate these parameters for marine species given the interactions among their in-water motion, metabolism, and heat transfer. To surmount these difficulties, we use our previously verified novel technique combining 3D digital design, computational fluid dynamics, and finite volume heat transfer modeling to find animal core temperatures. We then use this method to build a fundamental niche map for internesting and nesting leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea). With these niche maps we analyze three main nesting areas. We show that global warming poses a large overheating risk to leatherbacks in Southeast Asia, a slight risk to leatherbacks in the West Atlantic and a low risk to leatherbacks in the East Atlantic. We also show that the impact may be less on leatherbacks that shift their nesting location or who are smaller. Methods such these are important to produce efficiently and economically accurate maps of regions that will become inhospitable to species under global warming conditions.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"231-240","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biophysicalecology","Climate change","Global warming","Leatherback","Niche model","Sea turtle"]},{"key":"SNKR2PX9","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Sartori","lastName":"Martina"},{"firstName":"Schiavo","lastName":" Stefano"}],"title":"Connected we stand: A network perspective on trade and global food security","publication_title":"Food Policy","issn":"0306-9192","doi":"10.1016/j.foodpol.2015.10.004","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919215001207","abstract_note":"We analyze the link between virtual water trade, that is, the flow of water embodied in the international trade of agricultural goods, and vulnerability to external shocks from the vantage point of network analysis.

In this paper we adopt an international dimension and analyse the process of agricultural expansion across eleven Latin American countries over the period 1990–2010 to assess whether, in a context of agricultural intensification, different land tenure regimes impact differently on the realization of land-sparing or Jevons paradox. The results, based on a number of multivariate statistical models that controls for socio-economic factors, strongly suggest that the formal recognition of Indigenous Peoples and local communities’ forest rights has played an important role in promoting land sparing or attenuating Jevons paradox.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"316-322","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Agriculturalintensification","Deforestation","Indigenous and local communities’ forest","Jevons paradox","Land tenure"]},{"key":"FSHXDJNB","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Bochao"},{"firstName":"Bianchi","lastName":" Thomas S."},{"firstName":"Allison","lastName":" Mead A."},{"firstName":"Dimova","lastName":" Natasha T."},{"firstName":"Wang","lastName":" Houjie"},{"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":" Longjun"},{"firstName":"Diao","lastName":" Shaobo"},{"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":" Xueyan"},{"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":" Yu"},{"firstName":"Yao","lastName":" Peng"},{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":" Hongtao"},{"firstName":"Yao","lastName":" Qingzhen"},{"firstName":"Dong","lastName":" Wenhua"},{"firstName":"Sui","lastName":" Juanjuan"},{"firstName":"Yu","lastName":" Zhigang"}],"title":"Using multi-radiotracer techniques to better understand sedimentary dynamics of reworked muds in the Changjiang River estuary and inner shelf of East China Sea","publication_title":"Marine Geology","issn":"0025-3227","doi":"10.1016/j.margeo.2015.10.006","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322715300463","abstract_note":"Reworked muds, including mobile muds, resuspended sediments, and bio-mixed muds are ephemeral layers in the benthic boundary of large-river delta-front estuaries (LDEs). In this study, multiple radiotracers (210Pb, 137Cs, 234Th, 7Be, 235U, 228Th, 228Ra, 226Ra and 40K) were combined to evaluate the sedimentary dynamics of the mud belt on the inner shelf of the East China Sea (ECS) adjacent to the Changjiang River Estuary. We first categorized eight types of typical 210Pb profiles in marine sediments, and specified which ones could be used as possible evidence of reworked muds. The types of 210Pb profiles observed in previous studies and this study were then used to examine the depth distribution of reworked mud layers of the benthic boundary of ECS. We found that reworked mud depth in the along-shore mud belt of the inner shelf of ECS was deeper than those in the outer shelf and slope area, reaching up to 150cm deep in the Changjiang River LDE, and up to 50cm deep in the Zhejiang–Fujian coast mud area. Sediment core tracer profiles also showed that the reworked mud layer could be further divided into several sub-layers with distinct redox conditions and microbe (sulfate-reducing bacterial) abundance. SRB abundance intensively fluctuated with changing redox environment, and larger abundance values were usually observed in anoxic conditions. Based on 7Be and 234Th, the top layer (ca. 2–4cm thick) was the most modern and active zone, showing evidence of reworking on seasonal timescales. The deeper sections of the reworked mud layer were generally modified over longer timescale (years) which were examined using the more long-lived tracers, e.g., 137Cs, 228Thex, and 228Ra/226Ra ratio. We found for the first time in this region that age of the reworked layers was usually much younger than underlying accumulating (burial) layers. We posit that this multi-radionuclide approach is critical for evaluating the complex biogeochemical sediment record on delta-front estuaries of large rivers subject to changing climate conditions and human impacts over the last several centuries.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"76-86","language":"en","automatic_tags":["EastChina Sea","Large-river delta-front estuaries (LDEs)","Radiotracers","Reworked mud","Sedimentary dynamics"]},{"key":"3DB4NQ6U","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Herkt","lastName":"K.

Our knowledge of their geographic distributions and diversity patterns however is very limited – possibly the poorest among mammals – mainly due to their nocturnal and volant life history, and challenging fieldwork conditions in the tropics where most bat species occur. This knowledge gap obscures the geographic extent of ecosystem services provided by bats (i.e. pollination, seed dispersal and insect control), translates into inefficient conservation policies, and restricts macroecological analyses to coarse spatial resolutions. In contrast to the currently prevailing method of estimating species distributions using expert-drawn range maps, correlative species distribution models (SDMs) can provide estimates at very fine spatial grains and largely account for widespread sample bias as well as the prevalent Wallacean shortfall in species occurrence data. Very few such studies have hitherto been published that cover a large and complete taxonomic group with fine resolution at continental extent. Using an unparalleled amount of occurrence data, the MaxEnt algorithm and tailored solutions to specific modelling challenges, we created SDMs for nearly all 250 African bat species to explore emerging diversity patterns at a resolution of 1km2. Predicted species richness generally increases towards the equator conforming to expectations. Within the tropical area of elevated richness, several pronounced richness peaks and lows stand out, hinting at a complex interplay of determining factors. Richness gradients are often steep, decreasing strongly away from streams, and especially so in savanna biomes. Species richness also seems positively associated with rugged terrain, in particular at lower elevations. Centres of endemism are found primarily at low latitudes near major elevational ranges. Overlap with hotspots of species richness is rather low, and confined to five or six topodiverse, relatively low lying areas between western Guinea and the East African coast. Several poorly sampled regions are identified that may represent rewarding future survey targets. Our results demonstrate the value of stacking SDMs to infer plausible continent-wide diversity gradients at a spatial resolution fine enough to directly inform conservation policies and to open up new avenues in macroecological research.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"9-28","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Africa","Chiroptera","Range size rarity","Spatial resolution","Species distribution modelling (SDM)","Species richness"]},{"key":"55BG63MY","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Wolanski","lastName":"Eric"},{"firstName":"Elliott","lastName":" Michael"}],"title":"3 - Estuarine sediment dynamics","publication_title":"Estuarine Ecohydrology (Second Edition)","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444633989000039","abstract_note":"The estuarine hydrodynamic regimes define the type of bed sediments and these, in turn, the fauna and flora both on the bed and in the water column. Sediments are mobile, and their dynamics occur at time scales of millennia (the geomorphological time scales), of the tides, of storms, of river floods, of the seasons, and of turbulence (seconds to minutes). Erosion-deposition events occur in estuaries on daily (ebb-flood), weekly (spring-neap), lunar (tidal), equinoctial, and seasonal (wet-dry seasons) cycles, as well as at the time scales of millennia (the geomorphological time scales), of storms, of river floods, and of turbulence (seconds to minutes). This creates the removal, settlement, and storage of sediments. In addition, sediment delivery occurs both from the catchment and the coastal zone. Coupled with the underlying geomorphology, often with coastal soft coasts, this creates estuaries that are both sediment rich and also highly vulnerable. Estuaries are also sites of tidal pulsing of sediments moving upstream under relatively low river flow and high tidal flow conditions, and the freshwater pulsing downstream of sediments under high river flow and weaker tidal conditions. Storms in coastal waters may result in coastal sediment being transported and deposited in estuaries. All of these factors combine to create predominantly sedimentary environments and what are regarded as ephemeral environments, which may be either infilling or migrating seawards. The dynamics of the sediments, both on the bed and in the water column, determine their biological structure and functioning, and has repercussions for contaminant fate and effect, for the use and export of nutrients, for productivity, and for all users and uses of the estuary.

The inventory includes 1379 cores and sections with paleoecological data and more than 4800 modern samples from throughout the continent.

The most densely sampled regions are the Colombian Andes, the southeast coast of Brazil, and Patagonia. Underrepresented biomes are the warm temperate mixed forest (3%), dry forests (3%), and warm temperate rainforest (1%); whereas steppe, tropical rainforest, and cool grass shrublands, such as the páramos, are generally well represented (all >17%). There are 126 records that span the late Pleistocene to the Last Glacial Maximum transition (21,000calyr BP), and >20% of the records cover the Younger Dryas interval and the Pleistocene/Holocene transition.

Harbors have a significant impact on the present evolution of this coast, notably by affecting longshore sediment transport. However, little is known of the environmental drivers, notably the wave climate, that governs longshore sediment transport and the ensuing pattern of shoreline evolution of this coastal zone. This article aims to address this important knowledge gap by providing a general overview of coastal evolution in the Bight of Benin and the physical processes that control this evolution. Here, the 1979–2012 ERA-Interim hindcast is used to understand the temporal dynamics of longshore sediment transport. Oblique waves (annual average Hs=1.36m, Tp=9.6s, S-SW incidence) drive an eastward drift of approximately 500,000m3/yr. The waves driving this large longshore transport can be separated into two components with distinct origins and behavior: wind waves generated locally in the Gulf of Guinea and swell waves generated in the southern hemisphere sub- (30–35°S), and extra-tropics (45–60°S). The analysis undertaken here shows that the contribution to the gross annual longshore transport from swell wave-driven longshore currents is an order of magnitude larger than the local wind wave-driven longshore currents. Swell waves are dominantly generated by westerlies in the 40–60°S zone and to a lesser extent by trade winds at 30–35°S. The longshore sediment drift decay (−5% over 1979–2012) is found to be linked with a decrease in the intensity of westerly winds associated with their southward shift, in addition to a strengthening of the trade winds, which reduces the eastward sediment transport potential. The equatorial fluctuation of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is found to explain most of the variability in transport induced by wind waves, while the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), an extra-tropical mode, has a predominant influence on transport induced by swell waves. The ITCZ and SAM have, respectively, a negative and positive trend over the period 1979–2012 that explains the decrease in both wind- and swell-wave-induced transport. For future scenarii, General Circulation Models (GCMs) predict a stabilization of the SAM, and, thus, a non-substantial or weak change in longshore sediment transport can be expected on the coast of the Bight of Benin.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"48-59","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Coastalerosion","Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone","Longshore drift","Regional wave climate","South Atlantic Ocean","Southern Annular Mode"]},{"key":"FSKZCJ3W","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Kooch","lastName":"Yahya"},{"firstName":"Darabi","lastName":" Sakineh Mollaei"},{"firstName":"Hosseini","lastName":" Seyed Mohsen"}],"title":"Effects of Pits and Mounds Following Windthrow Events on Soil Features and Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in a Temperate Forest","publication_title":"Pedosphere","issn":"1002-0160","doi":"10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30066-7","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002016015300667","abstract_note":"Pit and mound micro–relief (resultant microsites from trees uprooted by windthrow) could have regimes of microclimate and soil features that differ from areas of undisturbed soil.

We summarized the FRA 2015 data for protective functions and ecosystem services, and analyzed increasing or decreasing trends of protective areas. The global forest area managed for protection of soil and water was 1.002billionha as of 2015, which was 25.1% of all global forested areas. Protective forests have increased by 0.181billionha over the past 25years mainly because more countries are now reporting protective forest areas (139 in 2015 vs 114 in 1990). However, average percentage of designated for protective forests did not change significantly from 1990 to 2015. Global forest area managed for ecosystem services is also now at 25.4% of global total forest area and has changed little over the past 25years. Among the twelve categories of protective forests, flood control, public recreation, and cultural services increased both in terms of percentage of total forest area and the number of reporting countries. Public awareness of the importance of forest resources for functions and services other than production continues to increase as evidenced by the increase of protective forest designations and reporting in many countries. Percentages of total forest area designated for both protective forests and ecosystem services show a dual-peak distribution of numbers of countries concentrated at 0% and 100%. This suggests a socio-economic influence for the designations. We examined five case study countries (Australia, Canada, China, Kenya, and Russia). The most dramatic changes in the past 25years have been in China where protective forests for soil and water resources increased from about 12% to 28% of forest area. The Russian Federation has also increased percentages of forest area devoted to soil and water resource protection and delivery of ecosystem services. Australia is now reporting in more protective forest categories whereas Kenya and Canada changed little. These five countries have their own classification of forest functions and recalculation methods of reporting for FRA 2015 were different. This demonstrates the difficulty in establishing a universal common designation scheme for multi-functions of forest. Production of more accurate assessments by further improvements in the reporting framework and data quality would help advance the value of FRA as the unique global database for forest functions integrated between forest ecosystems and social sciences.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"35-46","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Criteria","Ecosystem value","Forest conservation","Indicator","Multiple functions","Sustainable forest management"]},{"key":"PSTAB5DK","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Baraloto","lastName":"Christopher"},{"firstName":"Alverga","lastName":" Paula"},{"firstName":"Quispe","lastName":" Sufer Baéz"},{"firstName":"Barnes","lastName":" Grenville"},{"firstName":"Chura","lastName":" Nino Bejar"},{"firstName":"da Silva","lastName":" Izaias Brasil"},{"firstName":"Castro","lastName":" Wendeson"},{"firstName":"da Souza","lastName":" Harrison"},{"firstName":"de Souza Moll","lastName":" Iracema Elisabeth"},{"firstName":"Del Alcazar Chilo","lastName":" Jim"},{"firstName":"Linares","lastName":" Hugo Dueñas"},{"firstName":"Quispe","lastName":" Jorge Gárate"},{"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":" Dean"},{"firstName":"Marsik","lastName":" Matthew"},{"firstName":"Medeiros","lastName":" Herison"},{"firstName":"Murphy","lastName":" Skya"},{"firstName":"Rockwell","lastName":" Cara"},{"firstName":"Selaya","lastName":" Galia"},{"firstName":"Shenkin","lastName":" Alexander"},{"firstName":"Silveira","lastName":" Marcos"},{"firstName":"Southworth","lastName":" Jane"},{"firstName":"Vasquez Colomo","lastName":" Guido H."},{"firstName":"Perz","lastName":" Stephen"}],"title":"Effects of road infrastructure on forest value across a tri-national Amazonian frontier","publication_title":"Biological Conservation","issn":"0006-3207","doi":"10.1016/j.biocon.2015.08.024","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715300744","abstract_note":"Road construction demonstrably accelerates deforestation rates in tropical forests, but its consequences for forest degradation remain less clear.

We installed 69 vegetation plots in intact terra firme forests representative of local community holdings near and far from the IOH, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot. We observed strong geographic gradients in forest value components across the region, with increases from west to east in aboveground biomass and in the abundance of timber and non-timber forest product trees and regeneration. Plots in communities in Pando, Bolivia, where the IOH remains in part unpaved, had the highest aboveground biomass, standing timber volumes and Brazil nut tree density. In contrast, communities in Madre de Dios, Peru, where settlements and unpaved portions of the IOH have existed for decades, and in Acre, Brazil, where paving of the IOH has been underway for more than a decade, were more degraded. Seven of the fifteen forest value components we measured increased with increasing distance from the IOH, although the magnitude of these effects was weak. Landscape scale remote sensing analyses showed much stronger effects of road proximity on deforestation. We suggest that remote sensing techniques including canopy spectral signatures might be calibrated to characterize multiple components of forest value, so that we can estimate landscape scale impacts of infrastructure developments on both deforestation and forest degradation in tropical regions.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"674-681","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Açai","Biodiversity","Brazil nut","Carbon stocks","Connectivity","Infrastructure","Livelihood","NTFP","REDD","Road impact","Rubber","Timber","Tropical rainforest"]},{"key":"7UK6EG4V","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Butt","lastName":"C.

Following promising results obtained in temperate regions in North America and Europe, test orientation surveys were conducted to see whether similar procedures were applicable in the tropics, where conventional geological prospecting was largely precluded due to the extensive cover of a deep lateritic regolith and consequent lack of outcrop. After initial work in Sierra Leone and Nigeria, the emphasis transferred to East Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, aimed principally at Cu exploration. Many of the basic principles for exploration in dominantly residual, free-draining terrain were quickly established in this period. Exploration in terrains with more complex weathering histories, however, raised a number of difficulties due to leaching and secondary concentrations of elements, problems in selecting and identifying appropriate sample media, and extensive transported overburden. These were encountered especially in more arid regions in Australia and Africa during exploration for Ni and Au during the 1970s and 1980s. This led to a change in approach, placing weathering and geochemical dispersion in the context of regolith and landscape evolution –a return to the early concept of landscape geochemistry. The 3D expression of mineralization in the landscape is depicted as empirical conceptual models, that account for both relict features and active processes, and portray element associations, dispersion mechanisms and host materials. They also indicate suitable sample media, sampling intervals and procedures for analysis and interpretation.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"380-393","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Analysis","Landscape geochemistry","Lateritic terrain","Sampling","Weathering"]},{"key":"JQ63LK6D","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Cissé","lastName":"A.

The present study shows the preparation, characterization and in vitro antileishmanial activity of green-based silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with Cashew Nutshell Liquid (CNSL, main constituents: anacardic acid (AA) and cardol (CD). The synthesis of silver nanoparticles was achieved by reduction with sodium borohydride in the presence of anacardic acid or cardol under microwave irradiation (400 W, 60 °C, 5 min) resulting in AgAA and AgCD. In vitro assay showed opposite effects for AgAA and AgCD. While AgAA is highly toxic to macrophages (CC50 = 6.910 µg mL−1) and almost non-toxic for L.braziliensis (IC50 = 86.61 µg mL−1), AgCD results very selective toward killing the parasite (CC50 = 195.0 µg mL−1, IC50 = 11.54 µg mL−1). AA’s higher polarity and conical shape easily promote cell lysis by increasing cell permeability, while CD has a protective effect: for that reason, AA and AgAA were not further used for tests. CD (EC50 = 2.906 µg mL−1) had higher ability to kill intracellular amastigotes than AgCD (EC50 = 16.00 µg mL−1), however, less intact cells were seen on isolated CD tests. In addition, considering that NO is one of the critical molecular species for the intracellular control of Leishmania, we used Griess colorimetric test to analyze the effect of treatment with AgCD and CD. Overall, the in vitro antileishmanial tests indicate that AgCD should be further explored as a promising non-toxic treatment for CL. Neglected diseases, such as Leishmaniasis, constitute a group of communicable diseases that occur mainly in tropical countries. Considered a public health problem with limited treatment. Therefore, there is a need for new therapies. In this sense, our proposal was to evaluate in vitro two series of thiazolidine compounds (7a-7e and 8a-8e) against Leishmania infantum. We performed in vitro evaluations through macrophage cytotoxicity assays (J774) and nitric oxide production, activity against promastigotes and amastigotes, as well as ultrastructural analyzes in promastigotes. In the evaluation of cytotoxicity, the thiazolidine compounds presented CC50 values between 8.52 and 126.83 μM. Regarding the evaluation against the promastigote forms, the IC50 values ranged between 0.42 and 142.43 μM. Compound 7a was the most promising, as it had the lowest IC50. The parasites treated with compound 7a showed several changes, such as cell body shrinkage, shortening and loss of the flagellum, intense mitochondrial edema and cytoplasmic vacuolization, leading the parasite to cell inviability. In assays against the amastigote forms, the compound showed a low IC50 (0.65 μM). These results indicate that compound 7a was efficient for both evolutionary forms of the parasite. In silico studies suggest that the compound has good oral bioavailability. These results show that compound 7a is a potential drug candidate for the treatment of Leishmaniasis. The incidence of Leishmania/HIV co-infection is growing and few studies detail the cellular processes and macromolecules participating in co-infection. Thus, the goal of this study was to partially describe the Leishmania/HIV co-infection events by measuring molecular and functional parameters associated with both pathogens in vitro. MT-4 cells (human T-lymphocytes), primary monocytes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to HIV and/or Leishmania donovani. The cytopathic effects generated by the pathogens were observed through microscopy. Viral replication was assessed by monitoring p24 protein levels and parasitic proliferation/infectivity was determined using Giemsa staining. Changes in molecular markers were evaluated by ELISA and fluorescence assays. Our results showed that our system reassembles the main parameters previously described for Leishmania/HIV co-infection in patients in terms of potentiation of parasitic and viral replication/infectivity, amplification of syncytia induction, and alterations of cell viability. In addition, an amplification in NF-κB activation, changes in CXCR4/CCR5 surface expression, and a Th1→Th2 variation in cytokine/chemokine secretion were demonstrated. Altogether, this study could contribute to gain a deep understanding of the molecular events associated with Leishmania/HIV co-infection. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease found in tropical and subtropical regions in the world. The therapeutics used for the treatment against disease presents problems, mainly related to drug toxicity, route of administration, high cost and/or by emergence of resistant strains. In this context, the search for alternative antileishmanial candidates is desirable. Recently, a naphthoquinone derivative namely 2-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-β-L-galactopyranosyloxy)-1,4-naphthoquinone or Flau-A showed an effective in vitro biological action against Leishmania infantum. In the present study, the efficacy of this naphthoquinone derivative was evaluated in an in vivo infection model. BALB/c mice (n = 12 per group) were infected and later received saline or were treated with empty micelles (B/Mic), free Flau-A or it incorporated in Poloxamer 407-based micelles (Flau-A/Mic). The products were administered subcutaneously in the infected animals, which were then euthanized one (n = 6 per group) and 15 (n = 6 per group) days post-therapy, when immunological and parasitological evaluations were performed. Results showed that animals treated with Flau-A or Flau-A/Mic produced significantly higher levels of antileishmanial IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α, GM-CSF, nitrite and IgG2a isotype antibody, when compared to data found in the control (saline and B/Mic) groups; which showed significantly higher levels of parasite-specific IL-4, IL-10 and IgG1 antibody. In addition, animals receiving free Flau-A or Flau-A/Mic presented also significant reductions in the parasite load in their spleens, livers, bone marrows and draining lymph nodes, when compared to the controls. A low hepatic and renal toxicity was also found. Overall, Flau-A/Mic showed better immunological and parasitological results, when compared to the use of free molecule. In conclusion, preliminary data suggest that this composition could be considered in future studies as promising therapeutic candidate against VL. Leishmaniasis has infected more than 12 million people worldwide. This neglected tropical disease, causing 20,000–30,000 deaths per year, is a global health problem. The emergence of resistant parasites and serious side effects of conventional therapies has led to the search for less toxic and non-invasive alternative treatments. Photodynamic therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy to produce reactive oxygen species for the treatment of leishmaniasis. In this regard, natural and synthetic photosensitizers such as curcumin, hypericin, 5-aminolevulinic acid, phthalocyanines, phenothiazines, porphyrins, chlorins and nanoparticles have been applied. In this review, the recent advances on using photodynamic therapy for treating Leishmania species have been reviewed. Leishmaniasis is prevalent in Southern Europe, the Middle East, India, Africa, and Central and South America. Cutaneous leishmaniasis may spontaneously heal over time without treatment; however, risk of visceral dissemination and the impact of cosmetic defect are important concerns. We report a Case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in a patient who ever traveled to Mexico before the onset of a deteriorating wound around the swollen left eyebrow. A diagnosis of infection with Leishmania mexicana was made based on histopathological examination and molecular identification. Systemic treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and ketoconazole were administered with gradual healing of the lesion. Also, this traveler case implicates that the spread of endemic parasitic diseases may be a concealed risk on the public health for Taiwan underlying globalization. Understanding the variations in gene organization and its effect on the phenotype across different Leishmania species, and to study differential clinical manifestations of parasite within the host, we performed large scale analysis of codon usage patterns between Leishmania and other known Trypanosomatid species. We present the causes and consequences of codon usage bias in Leishmania genomes with respect to mutational pressure, translational selection and amino acid composition bias. We establish GC bias at wobble position that governs codon usage bias across Leishmania species, rather than amino acid composition bias. We found that, within Leishmania, homogenous codon context coding for less frequent amino acid pairs and codons avoiding formation of folding structures in mRNA are essentially chosen. We predicted putative differences in global expression between genes belonging to specific pathways across Leishmania. This explains the role of evolution in shaping the otherwise conserved genome to demonstrate species-specific function-level differences for efficient survival. In Brazil, the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by Leishmania infantum, while the tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) etiological agents are mainly Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania amazonensis. The canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) diagnosis is an important step of the VL control program in Brazil, which involves the elimination of infected dogs, the main urban VL reservoirs. The current serology-based diagnostic tests have shown cross-reactivity between these three species, whereas molecular diagnosis allows high sensitivity and specie identification. In the present study, 349 dogs of the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais state) were screened by conjunctival swab and the samples analyzed by ITS-1 nested PCR. Thirty dogs (8.5%) tested positive. The RFLP of amplicons using HaeIII demonstrated that 17/30 samples presented a banding pattern compatible with L. infantum, 4/30 matched with L. amazonenis, 1/30 with L. braziliensis and 8/30 showed a mixed infection pattern. The samples that were distinct of L. infantum or presented a mixed pattern were submitted to RFPL with HaeIII and RsaI enzymes that confirmed the mixed pattern. Such patterns were also confirmed by Sanger Sequencing. The results pointed eight dogs with mixed infections and the establishment of TL causing species in the Belo Horizonte dog population. These findings highlight the need for more comprehensive epidemiological studies, since the TL transmission profile might be changing. This study also shows the potential of the ITS1-nPCR associated with RFLP for the proper Leishmania diagnosis and typing in the dog population.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"579-593","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Cutaneousleishmaniasis","Leishmania infection","Leishmaniasis","Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis"]},{"key":"8UTV9H8Z","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Maia","lastName":"Carla"},{"firstName":"Cardoso","lastName":" Luís"}],"title":"Spread of Leishmania infantum in Europe with dog travelling","publication_title":"Veterinary Parasitology","issn":"0304-4017","doi":"10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.05.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401715002393","abstract_note":"Leishmania infantum is the etiological agent of canine leishmaniosis (CanL) in Europe, where it is endemic in the Mediterranean region, with dogs being considered the major reservoir of the parasite for humans and other mammalian hosts. The main transmission mode of Leishmania is by the bite of infected phlebotomine sand fly insects (genus Phlebotomus), which are the only proven vectors of this zoonotic protozoan. Less common, non-vectorial transmission between dogs include infection through transfused blood products from infected donors, transplacental and venereal transmission. CanL has exhibited an expansion to new locations in Europe, mainly northwards, either by territorial contiguity, often in association with global warming that favours vectorial transmission, or by the long-distance importation of infected dogs. The increasing incidence of CanL in countries where the disease is not endemic is challenging owners, veterinarians and government authorities. Most infected dogs in these new areas have been relocated from or travelled with their owners to endemic regions, but in some cases transmission might have also been autochthonous. In the absence of prophylactic measures, the introduction of infected dogs in areas previously free of endemic CanL but which have competent sand fly vectors can result in a potential persistence of L. infantum. The spread of L. infantum in Europe is reviewed with a focus on transmission, epidemiology and geographic distribution of endemic and non-endemic CanL, infection and disease in humans and animal hosts other than dogs, together with prevention and additional control strategies.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"2-11","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Canineleishmaniosis","Dog","Europe","Importation","Travelling"]},{"key":"FRLZAZQR","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Sawada","lastName":"Yoshito"},{"firstName":"Suwa","lastName":" Rempei"},{"firstName":"Jindo","lastName":" Keiji"},{"firstName":"Endo","lastName":" Takahiro"},{"firstName":"Oki","lastName":" Kazuo"},{"firstName":"Sawada","lastName":" Haruo"},{"firstName":"Arai","lastName":" Egidio"},{"firstName":"Shimabukuro","lastName":" Yosio Edemir"},{"firstName":"Celes","lastName":" Carlos Henrique Souza"},{"firstName":"Campos","lastName":" Moacir Alberto Assis"},{"firstName":"Higuchi","lastName":" Francisco Gasparetto"},{"firstName":"Lima","lastName":" Adriano José Nogueira"},{"firstName":"Higuchi","lastName":" Niro"},{"firstName":"Kajimoto","lastName":" Takuya"},{"firstName":"Ishizuka","lastName":" Moriyoshi"}],"title":"A new 500-m resolution map of canopy height for Amazon forest using spaceborne LiDAR and cloud-free MODIS imagery","publication_title":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","issn":"1569-8432","doi":"10.1016/j.jag.2015.04.003","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243415000811","abstract_note":"In the present study, we aimed to map canopy heights in the Brazilian Amazon mainly on the basis of spaceborne LiDAR and cloud-free MODIS imagery with a new method (the Self-Organizing Relationships method) for spatial modeling of the LiDAR footprint.

Osteoderms of Euphractus sexcinctus, Dasypus novemcinctus, Propraopus sulcatus, and Pachyarmaterium brasiliense were retrieved, representing an expansion on the known distribution of the taxa. The specimens are described herein, and their geographic and chronologic distributions in Brazil are reviewed. Numerical dates allied to the presence of biostratigraphically relevant taxa indicate a Late Pleistocene–middle Holocene age. Considering that E. sexcinctus and D. novemcinctus occupy the area nowadays, why did part of the past cingulate community survive and the other part became extinct? We believe that their distribution was affected by paleoclimatic shifts, especially during glacial/interglacial cycles. The colder and arid climate of the Pleistocene glacial periods favored the development of open forests and savannas in Brazil, whereas grasslands and steppes were predominant in higher latitudes. Probably, Propraopus and Pachyarmatherium (from south and north, respectively) took refuge in lower latitudes, including in Brazil. Later, during the interglacial cycle, warm and moist climates favored the development of an evergreen forest in central Brazil, leading Propraopus and Pachyarmatherium to extinction and positively selecting E. sexcinctus and D. novemcinctus.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"118-125","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Armadillos","Biogeography","Dasypodidae","Pleistocene","South America","Taxonomy"]},{"key":"VSIYQJS7","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Angeon","lastName":"Valérie"},{"firstName":"Bates","lastName":" Samuel"}],"title":"Reviewing Composite Vulnerability and Resilience Indexes: A Sustainable Approach and Application","publication_title":"World Development","issn":"0305-750X","doi":"10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.02.011","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X15000443","abstract_note":"Vulnerability–resilience indexes fail to grasp all dimensions of sustainability, whereas sustainable development has gained momentum.

The Cant variability in the water masses is evaluated from the comparison of two hydrographic sections along 7.5°N carried out in 1993 and 2010. During both cruises, high Cant concentrations are detected in the upper layers, with values decreasing progressively towards the deep layers. Overall, the Cant concentrations increase from 1993 to 2010, with a large increment in the upper North Atlantic Deep Water layer of about 0.18±0.03μmolkg−1y−1. In 2010, the Cant inventory along the whole section amounts to 58.9±2.2 and 45.1±2.0molm−2 using CO2 and CFC based methods, respectively, with most Cant accumulating in the western basin. Considering the time elapsed between the two cruises, Cant storage rates of 1.01±0.18 and 0.75±0.17molm−2y−1 (CO2 and CFC based methods, respectively) are obtained. Below ∼1000m, these rates follow the pace expected from a progressive increase of Cant at steady state; above ∼1000m, Cant increases faster, mainly due to the retreat of the Antarctic Intermediate Waters.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"256-270","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"47M8FZZY","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Williams","lastName":"Elizabeth K."},{"firstName":"Rosenheim","lastName":" Brad E."},{"firstName":"Allison","lastName":" Mead"},{"firstName":"McNichol","lastName":" Ann P."},{"firstName":"Xu","lastName":" Li"}],"title":"Quantification of refractory organic material in Amazon mudbanks of the French Guiana Coast","publication_title":"Marine Geology","issn":"0025-3227","doi":"10.1016/j.margeo.2015.02.009","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322715000456","abstract_note":"Sub-oxic overturning mudbanks originating in the Amazon outlet and traveling northwestward along the coast of South America store 3.5Tg organic carbon on the Amazon shelf, annually. The predominance of old soil carbon burial associated with the sediment has been supported by relatively old bulk radiocarbon ages (~2200–3200 14Cy) reported, but this amount has yet to be quantified for this dynamic setting. Here, we employ ramped pyrolysis radiocarbon dating to mudbank sediments from three cores to further constrain the amount of refractory sedimentary organic carbon present. Using radiocarbon age as a proxy for reactivity, we find that at least 36% of this organic carbon is pre-aged refractory terrestrial organic carbon, likely sourced from terrestrial soils and averaging ages of 16,100±300 14Cy. This implies significant preservation of pre-aged terrestrial soil material in this marine environment despite the mobility and oxygen availability in the muds. Concurrently, an average of 77% of this organic material is aged over 1000 14Cy, consistent with previous estimates that the majority of organic carbon buried along the shelf is refractory. Analyses of extracted lignin phenols and terrestrial humic acids also support this preservation of refractory terrestrial material. These data indicate that sediment discharged from the Amazon River may preserve refractory terrestrial carbon in marine sediments at a minimum of 3.1TgC/y, which is more efficient than originally thought.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"93-101","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Carboncycling","Mudbanks","Radiocarbon","Ramped pyrolysis","Sedimentary organic material (SOM)"]},{"key":"6H9D6S9E","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Barnard","lastName":"A."},{"firstName":"Sager","lastName":" W.

Multibeam echo soundings from cruise AT21-02 acquired using a Kongsberg EM122 system were used to define a region with several ∼600–900 m tall gas plumes in the water column directly above cratered hummocky regions of the sea floor having relatively high backscatter at a water depth of ∼1500 m. The natural gas hydrate stability zone reaches a minimum depth of ∼600 m in the water column, similar to that of the tallest imaged bubble plumes, which implies hydrate shells on the gas bubbles. Tilting of the plume shows current shear in the water column, with a current direction from the northwest to southeast at 128°, a direction similar to the transport direction of North Atlantic Deep Water in this region. The source of hydrocarbons, determined from existing geochemical data, suggests the gas source was subjacent marine Cretaceous source rocks. North–south trending faults, craters and mud volcanoes associated with the gas plumes point to the presence of a deep plumbing system and indicate that gas is a driver of mud volcanism in this region. The widespread occurrence of seafloor morphology related to venting indicates that subsea emissions from the Barbados Accretionary Complex are substantial.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"31-42","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Barbados","Geology","Hydrate","Marine","Methane","Multibeam","Subsea","Water column"]},{"key":"DYX7H8DK","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Jefferson","lastName":"Thomas A."},{"firstName":"Webber","lastName":" Marc A."},{"firstName":"Pitman","lastName":" Robert L."}],"title":"4 - Cetaceans","publication_title":"Marine Mammals of the World (Second Edition)","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095427500044","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"24-357","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"2L7XLLJI","item_type":"bookSection","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Vega","lastName":"Fernando E."},{"firstName":"Infante","lastName":" Francisco"},{"firstName":"Johnson","lastName":" Andrew J."}],"title":"Chapter 11 - The Genus Hypothenemus, with Emphasis on H. hampei, the Coffee Berry Borer","publication_title":"Bark Beetles","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124171565000113","abstract_note":"The genus Hypothenemus consists of 181 species with worldwide distribution and with greatest diversity in the tropics.

Government response agencies include fire departments, law enforcement, emergency management (civil protection), emergency medical services, the military, and many other government agencies as appropriate. Emergency management approaches should suit the organizational framework within each country. This could include structures that are locally based, regionally based, or nationally based. Under certain circumstances, there may be no national government emergency management structure. A significant portion of development assistance funds activities that are rooted in emergency management.

Besides air pollution from industry derived emissions and motor vehicles, the rising trend can only be explained by gross changes in the environments where we live. The world economy has been transformed over the last 25 years with developing countries being at the core of these changes. Around the planet, in both developed and developing countries, environments are undergoing profound changes. Many of these changes are considered to have negative effects on respiratory health and to enhance the frequency and severity of respiratory diseases such as asthma in the general population. Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere have already warmed the planet substantially, causing more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods – all of which can put the respiratory health of the public at risk. These changes in climate and air quality have a measurable impact not only on the morbidity but also the mortality of patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases. The massive increase in emissions of air pollutants due to economic and industrial growth in the last century has made air quality an environmental problem of the first order in a large number of regions of the world. A body of evidence suggests that major changes to our world are occurring and involve the atmosphere and its associated climate. These changes, including global warming induced by human activity, have an impact on the biosphere, biodiversity, and the human environment. Mitigating this huge health impact and reversing the effects of these changes are major challenges. This statement of the World Allergy Organization (WAO) raises the importance of this health hazard and highlights the facts on climate-related health impacts, including: deaths and acute morbidity due to heat waves and extreme meteorological events; increased frequency of acute cardio-respiratory events due to higher concentrations of ground level ozone; changes in the frequency of respiratory diseases due to trans-boundary particle pollution; altered spatial and temporal distribution of allergens (pollens, molds, and mites); and some infectious disease vectors. According to this report, these impacts will not only affect those with current asthma but also increase the incidence and prevalence of allergic respiratory conditions and of asthma. The effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still not well defined, and more studies addressing this topic are needed. Global warming is expected to affect the start, duration, and intensity of the pollen season on the one hand, and the rate of asthma exacerbations due to air pollution, respiratory infections, and/or cold air inhalation, and other conditions on the other hand.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"25","language":"en","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"S26GWXGJ","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Thomsen","lastName":"Philip Francis"},{"firstName":"Willerslev","lastName":" Eske"}],"title":"Environmental DNA – An emerging tool in conservation for monitoring past and present biodiversity","publication_title":"Biological Conservation","issn":"0006-3207","doi":"10.1016/j.biocon.2014.11.019","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320714004443","abstract_note":"The continuous decline in Earth’s biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity – especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) – defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material – is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.","date_added":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","date_modified":"2022-06-01 16:31:09","pages":"4-18","language":"en","automatic_tags":["Biodiversity","Conservation","DNA metabarcoding","eDNA","Environmental DNA","Extinction","Monitoring"]},{"key":"R5AGXUJ4","item_type":"journalArticle","publication_year":"2015","author":[{"firstName":"Gonzalvo","lastName":"Joan"},{"firstName":"Giovos","lastName":" Ioannis"},{"firstName":"Mazzariol","lastName":" Sandro"}],"title":"Prevalence of epidermal conditions in common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Gulf of Ambracia, western Greece","publication_title":"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","issn":"0022-0981","doi":"10.1016/j.jembe.2014.11.004","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098114002998","abstract_note":"Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) of the Gulf of Ambracia are exposed to numerous growing anthropogenic impacts, rendering them more prone to cutaneous changes.

However, in the past deployment has been strongly dependent on policy support. With the recent rapid decrease in module costs, rooftop PV is exhibiting a growing potential to be an attractive investment even in the absence of subsidies. While many drivers of economic performance have been investigated in isolation, a holistic analysis of how realistic combinations of influencing factors determine rooftop PV׳s economics is still missing. We identify the most important influencing factors through a comprehensive review of the literature. We then provide a model-based techno-economic analysis of a small-scale grid-connected residential building PV system, assessing how region-specific geographic, technological, and economic parameters jointly influence performance. We find that in many regions rooftop PV can already today be an attractive investment, even in the absence of subsidies. No regional influencing factor can in isolation guarantee or impede performance. Moreover, in most regions it might be possible to further improve economic performance. Self-consumption is identified as a likely driver of value in the future, while low electricity prices (and thus fossil fuel subsidies) present a powerful barrier in some regions. Based on these insights, we discuss implications for policy makers and investors with regard to recognizing and shaping attractive markets and investments.","date_added":"2022-06-01

En effet, dans un contexte de commerce extérieur déséquilibré entre les territoires du Plateau des Guyanes et ceux de la Caraïbe, il est nécessaire de développer des infrastructures et des modes de transport pour les désenclaver et favoriser des échanges commerciaux intra zone. En Guyane, ce déséquilibre est porté par l'importation essentiellement de la France et de l'Europe alors qu'elle est voisine du Brésil-700 km-avec qui, elle ne dispose que de liaisons économiques illégales ou informelles et peu d'infrastructures pouvant faciliter des échanges entre eux. Les relations maritimes interrégionales étant à ces jours inexistantes, notre objectif est de croiser la vision et perception des acteurs les plus proches des activités économiques de notre projet, afin de déterminer si le TMCD est une solution crédible de transport et identifier les critères de viabilité du projet en vue de sa mise en oeuvre et de sa prospérité.","date_added":"2022-06-28T10:56:24Z","date_modified":"2022-06-28T10:56:24Z","pages":"","language":"fr","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"WA9M63WC","item_type":"thesis","publication_year":"2016","author":[{"firstName":"Goulamoussene","lastName":"Youven"},{"firstName":"Hérault","lastName":" Bruno"},{"firstName":"Linguet","lastName":" Laurent"}],"title":"Variabilité de la structure de la canopée en forêt tropicale humide : l’apport de la très haute résolution spatiale en Guyane Française","publication_title":"","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://www.theses.fr/2016YANE0006","abstract_note":"La Guyane française est une région située sur le Plateau des Guyanes en Amérique du sud. Elle présente à la fois une grande originalité en termes de biodiversité, un bon état de conservation et une forte contribution au stock de carbone Amazonien. Les connaissances sur  l’évolution de la structure forestière de la Guyane française restent cependant insuffisantes pour offrir une gestion optimale à l’échelle du territoire. La disponibilité sans précédent de données de télédétection à très haute résolution spatiale telles que le LiDAR , sur de larges couvertures  nous offre l'opportunité d’évaluer la ressource forestière de la Guyane Française. Les travaux réalisés dans le cadre de cette thèse visent prioritairement à étudier la structure et les variations de la hauteur de canopée, les facteurs déterminant sa variabilité ainsi que les conséquences des activités d’exploitation forestière.  Les données utilisées au cours de la thèse proviennent d’un LiDAR aéroporté et des données de terrains de l'Office National des Forêts (ONF). Ce manuscrit de thèse est divisé en trois grandes parties. La première partie introduit la problématique et fixe les objectifs de la thèse. La seconde partie prend la forme dite « sur article », c'est-à-dire que les différents chapitres qui la compose sont des articles scientifiques publiés ou en cours de publication, elle est composée de trois études. (i) Une étude concernant la détection des trouées et des déterminants  environnementaux sur la distribution de tailles des trouées en forêt non exploitée : Comment caractériser la distribution de taille des trouées et est-ce qu’il y a des déterminants environnementaux qui influencent la distribution statistique de taille de trouées? Cet article à été soumis dans Biogeoscience. (ii) Une étude du contrôle de l'environnement sur la structure et les variations de la hauteur de canopée à différentes résolutions spatiales. Quelles échelles spatiales sont pertinentes pour analyser les déterminants environnementaux des variations de hauteur de la canopée en forêt tropicale à partir des données de télédétection ? Comment l’environnement peut aider, ou pas, à cartographier la hauteur de la canopée en forêt tropicale ? Cet article à été accepté pour publication dans Remote Sensing. (iii) Une troisième étude où nous avons quantifié les effets de l’exploitation à faible impact (EFI) sur la structure et  la variation de la hauteur de canopée. Quelles sont les effets de l’exploitation forestière sur les variations de hauteur de canopée et sur la distribution de taille des trouées ? Cet article sera soumis pour publication dans une revue scientifique (Forest Ecology and Management). Dans la dernière partie, après une synthèse des principaux résultats, nous proposons des pistes de développement.","date_added":"2022-06-28T10:59:02Z","date_modified":"2022-06-28T10:59:02Z","pages":"","language":"","automatic_tags":["526.8GOU","Canopée","Canopy","Forêt tropicale","French Guiana","Guyane Francaise","Lidar","LiDAR","Pareto","Pierced","Rain forest","Teledetection","Télédétection","Trouée"]},{"key":"JT8239WG","item_type":"thesis","publication_year":"2017","author":[{"firstName":"Dezécache","lastName":"Camille"}],"title":"Les fondements de REDD+ à l’épreuve des modèles de déforestation : cas d’étude sur le Plateau des Guyanes","publication_title":"","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01564584","abstract_note":"Depuis ses balbutiements au début des années 2000, la Réduction des Emissions liées à la Déforestation et la Dégradation forestière, plus connue sous le sigle REDD+, a peu à peu été admise comme un moyen indispensable des politiques globales de lutte contre le changement climatique. Reposant sur le concept de « déforestation évitée », elle nécessite la formulation d’un scénario de référence servant à évaluer les efforts des pays dans la maîtrise de leur niveau de déforestation. Ces scénarios sont au cœur de nombreux débats politiques et scientifiques. Cette thèse constitue une mise en perspective des principes de REDD+ avec, comme cas d’étude, le Plateau des Guyanes. Dans un premier temps, on présentera l’établissement d’un modèle spatialisé de déforestation pour la Guyane française, insistant sur la nécessité de se focaliser sur les moteurs socio-économiques de la déforestation. Ce constat sera renforcé, dans un second temps, par l’étude de la déforestation liée à l’orpaillage à l’échelle de l’ensemble du Plateau des Guyanes, montrant un impact très fort du cours de l’or et des contextes politiques sur le niveau déforestation. Ces résultats alimenteront une discussion critique du mécanisme REDD+, basé sur la formulation de scénarios de référence potentiellement très variables et fondés sur des déterminants davantage politiques que scientifiques, ouvrant ainsi la porte à un potentiel chantage environnemental.","date_added":"2022-06-28T11:02:00Z","date_modified":"2022-06-28T11:02:00Z","pages":"","language":"fr","automatic_tags":[""]},{"key":"B6BD9IPC","item_type":"webpage","publication_year":"2007","author":[{"firstName":"Ghram","lastName":"Aziza"},{"firstName":"Delaître","lastName":" Eric"}],"title":"Les états de surface en zone aride à partir d'indices radiométriques et de classifications multitemporelles d'images Landsat TM prises sur la région de Menzel Habib (Tunisie méridionale)","publication_title":"","issn":"","doi":"","url":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01828307","abstract_note":"","date_added":"2022-06-28T11:04:39Z","date_modified":"2022-06-28T11:04:39Z","pages":"","language":"fr","automatic_tags":["COULEUR","COUVERT VEGETAL","DESERTIFICATION","ETAT DE SURFACE DU SOL","FACTEUR ANTHROPIQUE","FACTEUR CLIMATIQUE","GEOMATIQUE","IMAGE SATELLITE","MENZEL HABIB","PAYSAGE","RADIOMETRIE","REFLECTANCE","SATELLITE LANDSAT","SURFACE DU SOL","TELEDETECTION SPATIALE","TUNISIE","TUNISIE SUD","ZONE ARIDE"]},{"key":"XL43Z9RY","item_type":"webpage","publication_year":"2020","author":[{"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Anh Thu"}],"title":"Le Vietnam : une destination touristique kitsch ?
